The ISO image is configured to boot as the boot sector of the ISO file in isolinux / isolinux.bin (we assume that we are at the root)

The file system of the distribution is located in the i386-squashsfs-root so it is convenient to work as root and take special care to use the permissions on files and directories.

The script for building the ISO is makeiso.sh and must be run as root. Git commands must be run as root.

Requirements for building the ISO image:
-genisoimage
-squashfs-tools
