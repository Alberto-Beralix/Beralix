Database layout
===============

This Xapian database indexes Debian package information.  To query the
database, open it as ``/var/lib/apt-xapian-index/index``.

Data are indexed either as terms or as values.  Words found in package
descriptions are indexed lowercase, and all other kinds of terms have an
uppercase prefix as documented below.

Numbers are indexed as Xapian numeric values.  A list of the meaning of the
numeric values is found in ``/var/lib/apt-xapian-index/values``.

The data sources used for indexing are:

 * Package aliases: aliases for well known programs
 * app-install information: terms, categories and popcon values extracted from the app-install .desktop files
 * Apt tags: Debtags tag information from the Packages file
 * Cataloged time: store the timestamp when the package was first cataloged
 * Package descriptions: terms extracted from the package descriptions using Xapian's TermGenerator
 * DisplayNames: pkgname and package display names indexed as values
 * Origin: Origin information
 * Package relationships: Debian package relationships
 * Package sections: Debian package sections
 * Sizes: package sizes indexed as values
 * SoftwareCenterMetadata: SoftwareCenter meta information
 * Translated package descriptions: terms extracted from the translated package descriptions using Xapian's TermGenerator

This Xapian index follows the conventions for term prefixes described in
``/usr/share/doc/xapian-omega/termprefixes.txt.gz``.

Extra Debian data sources can define more extended prefixes (starting with
``X``): their meaning is documented below together with the rest of the data
source documentation.

At the very least, at least the package name (with the ``XP`` prefix) will
be present in every document in the database.  This allows to quickly
lookup a Xapian document by package name.

The user data associated to a Xapian document is the package name.

Active data sources

Package aliases
===============

The Aliases data source does not change documents in the index, but
adds synonims to the database. Synonims allow to obtain good
results while looking for well-know software names, even if such
software does not exist in Debian.


app-install information
=======================

The AppInstall data source reads .desktop files from /usr/share/app-install/desktop/
and adds the following terms:

 * keywords from the .desktop descriptions, via Xapian's
   TermGenerator, in all requested locales;
 * .desktop categories, with prefix XDT;
 * name of .desktop file, with prefix XDF;
 * a single term "XD", marking that the package contains .desktop
   files.

It also adds an "app-popcon" value with popcon ranks from the
app-install .desktop files.


Apt tags
========

The Apt tags data source indexes Debtags tags as found in the
Packages file as terms with the ``XT`` prefix; for example:
'XTrole::program'.

Using the ``XT`` terms, queries can be enhanced with semantic
information.  Xapian's support for complex expressions in queries
can be used to great effect: for example::

    XTrole::program AND XTuse::gameplaying AND (XTinterface::x11 OR XTinterface::3d)

``XT`` terms can also be used to improve the quality of search
results.  For example, the ``gimp`` package would not usually show
up when searching the terms ``image editor``.  This can be solved
using the following technique:

 1. Perform a normal query
 2. Put the first 5 or so results in an Rset
 3. Call Enquire::get_eset using the Rset and an expand filter that
    only accepts ``XT`` terms.  This gives you the tags that are
    most relevant to the query.
 4. Add the resulting terms to the initial query, and search again.

The Apt tags data source will not work when Debtags is installed,
as Debtags is able to provide a better set of tags.


Cataloged time
==============

This datasource simply stores a value with the timestamp
when the package was first cataloged. This is useful to e.g.
implement a 'Whats new' feature.


Package descriptions
====================

The Descriptions data source simply uses Xapian's TermGenerator to
tokenise and index the package descriptions.

Currently this creates normal terms as well as stemmed terms
prefixed with ``Z``.


DisplayNames
============

The DisplayNames data source indexes the display name as the
``display_name`` Xapian value.
``pkgname`` Xapian value.


Origin
======

The Origin data source indexes origin information
It uses the prefix XO


Package relationships
=====================

Indexes one term per relationship declared with other packages. All
relationship terms have prefixes starting with XR plus an extra
prefix letter per relationship type.

Terms are built using only the package names in the relationship
fields: versioning and boolean operators are ignored.


Package sections
================

The section is indexed literally, with the prefix XS.


Sizes
=====

The Sizes data source indexes the package size and the installed
size as the ``packagesize`` and ``installedsize`` Xapian values.


SoftwareCenterMetadata
======================

Software-center metadata
It uses the prefixes:
  AA for the Application name
  AP for the Package name
  AC for the categories
  AT to "application" for applications
It sets the following xapian values from the software-center
enums:
  XapianValues.ICON
  XapianValues.ICON_NEEDS_DOWNLOAD
  XapianValues.ICON_URL
  XapianValues.SCREENSHOT_URL
  XapianValues.THUMBNAIL_URL


Translated package descriptions
===============================

The TranslatedDescriptions data source reads translated description
files from /var/lib/apt/lists, then uses Xapian's TermGenerator to tokenise and
index their content.

Currently this creates normal terms as well as stemmed terms
prefixed with ``Z``.
