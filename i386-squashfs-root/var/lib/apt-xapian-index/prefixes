# This file contains the information about keyword prefixes used in the
# APT Xapian index.
#
# Xapian allows to prefix some terms so they can be told apart from
# normal keywords: this is used for example with Debtags tags, and
# stemmed forms.
#
# This file lists terms with their index prefix, their queryparser
# prefix, whether queryparser should treat it as boolean or
# probabilistic and a short description.
