 The prefork MPM provides a non-threaded implementation using a variable
 number of processes where each process handles only one connection
 at the same time. It is not as fast as threaded models, but is considered to
 be more stable. It is appropriate for sites that need to maintain
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries, and is the best MPM for
 isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will not
 affect any other.

 BackupPC is disk based and not tape based. This particularity allows
 features not found in any other backup solution:
  * Clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk I/O.
    Identical files across multiple backups of the same or different PC are
    stored only once resulting in substantial savings in disk storage and disk
    writes. Also known as "data deduplication".
  * Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage.
    CPU impact of compression is low since only new files (those not already
    in the pool) need to be compressed.
  * A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view log files,
    configuration, current status and allows users to initiate and cancel
    backups and browse and restore files from backups very quickly.
  * No client-side software is needed. On WinXX the smb protocol is used.
    On Linux or Unix clients, rsync or tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) can be used
  * Flexible restore options. Single files can be downloaded from any backup
    directly from the CGI interface. Zip or Tar archives for selected files
    or directories can also be downloaded from the CGI interface.
  * BackupPC supports mobile environments where laptops are only intermittently
    connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).
  * Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
    in parallel.

Description-md5: 29e82a31bb4248987c1cee43d589e134
Description-en: Support for extra binary formats
 The binfmt_misc kernel module, contained in versions 2.1.43 and later of the
 Linux kernel, allows system administrators to register interpreters for
 various binary formats based on a magic number or their file extension, and
 cause the appropriate interpreter to be invoked whenever a matching file is
 executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of the #! executable
 interpreter mechanism.
 .
 This package provides an 'update-binfmts' script with which package
 maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module without
 having to worry about writing their own init.d scripts, and which sysadmins
 can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this module.

 Recording in disk-at-once mode writes the complete disc, i.e. lead-in, one or
 more tracks and lead-out, in a single step. The commonly used track-at-once
 (TAO) mode writes each track independently which requires link blocks between
 two tracks. You probably want to use this if you're copying a CD with multiple
 tracks, like most audio CDs.

 you should not rely on checksecurity to actually provide any useful
 information concerning the security or vulnerability of your system.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple

 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.

 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).

 either in binary form, or as sources (with e. g. DKMS). It extracts the
 modules' modaliases from either the compile .ko files themselves (for packages
 which ship them in compiled form, using modinfo), or from a package file
 debian/packagename.modaliases.

Description-en: creating and reading constant databases
 freecdb is a fast, reliable, simple package for creating and reading
 constant databases. Its database structure provides several features:
 .
  * Fast lookups: A successful lookup in a large database normally takes
    just two disk accesses.  An unsuccessful lookup takes only one.
  * Low overhead: A database uses 2048 bytes, plus 24 bytes per record,
    plus the space for keys and data.
  * No random limits: cdb can handle any database up to 4 gigabytes.
    There are no other restrictions; records don't even have to fit into
    memory.  Databases are stored in a machine-independent format.
  * Fast atomic database replacement: cdbmake can rewrite an entire
    database two orders of magnitude faster than other hashing packages.
  * Fast database dumps: cdbdump prints the contents of a database in
    cdbmake-compatible format.
 .
 This package is derived from the cdb package, and uses the original
 cdb library.  See http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html

Description-en: play the game of Go
 GNU Go is a free program that plays the game of Go. It provides a
 text-only user interface, have a look at the cgoban or qgo package if
 you want to play on a graphical board.
 .
 Go is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history
 of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the
 game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game
 Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and
 Goe (Taiwanese).
 .
 In this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory
 than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It
 is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between
 nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world,
 especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many
 worldwide competitions being held.
 .
 The game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the
 board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard
 board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be
 used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners;
 more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.
 .
 Compared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer
 rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go
 can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two
 types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so
 have a fun time playing the game with your friends.

 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub2.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 EFI-IA32 architecture, such as the one provided by Intel Macs (that is, unless
 a BIOS interface has been activated).  It will not automatically install
 GRUB as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg
 on upgrade, so most people should install grub-efi-ia32 instead.

Description-en: GRUB gfxpayload blacklist
 The 'set gfxpayload=keep' facility in GRUB provides smooth graphical
 handover to the Linux kernel.  Unfortunately, this does not work on all
 systems, resulting in a black or corrupt display.  This package provides a
 blacklist of PCI IDs which fail.
 .
 We maintain this separately from GRUB because it is likely to be updated on
 a different schedule.

Package: latex-beamer
Description-md5: d2345de1842406c63c25458fb9c962ce
Description-en: LaTeX class to produce presentations
 The beamer class is a LaTeX class that allows you to create a beamer
 presentation. It can also be used to create slides. It behaves
 similarly to other packages like Prosper, but has the advantage that
 it works together directly with pdflatex, but also with dvips.
 .
 Once you have installed the beamer class, the basic steps to create a
 beamer presentation are the following:
  - Specify beamer as document class instead of article.
  - Structure your LaTeX text using \section and \subsection commands.
  - Place the text of the individual slides inside \frame commands.
  - Run pdflatex on the text (or latex and dvips).
 .
 The beamer class has several useful features: You don't need any
 external programs to use it other than pdflatex, but it works also
 with dvips. You can easily and intuitively create sophisticated
 overlays. Finally, you can easily change the whole slide theme or only
 parts of it.

 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several

 .
 C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method resolution
 order under multiple inheritence. It was first introduced in the langauge
 Dylan, and then later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order)
 for the new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as
 the 'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot
 objects as well.

 Algorithm::Diff is a Perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It can compare two files and find
 the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
 common Unix tool 'diff'.
 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).

 Algorithm::Diff::XS is a Perl diff utility module based on Joe Schaefer's
 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.
 .
 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

 three sets of items, known as the original, left and right, this module can
 take a three-way difference or merge them. Taking a difference provides an
 array reference that is very similar to the behaviour of Algorithm::Diff. One
 can also implement custom conflict resolution using the CONFLICT callback.

 file in %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be
 configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have
 changed on disk. It can also monitor only specific modules that have
 registered themselves with Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the
 check only when a special touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number
 of stat() calls per request.

Description-en: Analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient
 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain
 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte
 code instructions, in particular.
 .
 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program
 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more
 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.
 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to
 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class
 files.

Description-en: Boost.org libraries documentation
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.

Package: libbsf-java
Description-md5: 7edf52967a3df85d4e3d6a32472105f0
Description-en: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter
 .
 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian
 package since Jacl, NetRexx (non-free) are not packaged.

 Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via
 its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from
 Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may
 themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
 above).
 .
 When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl
 first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes
 searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe
 "height-first" is the word) search. In the above example, it'd first look in
 Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then
 Chemicals.

 This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the
 list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with
 no duplicates.

 This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by
 ORO, Inc. This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP, Telnet, POP3, FTP,
 NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like Time and Echo as well
 as BSD R command support. The purpose of the library is to provide
 fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore,
 some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our
 philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible
 (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide
 access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the
 programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP
 packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are
 exposed). NetComponents was originally a commercial product, but after
 ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for those who
 found it useful. However, no updates have been made since version
 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations have
 expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available under

 The focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired date or time
 operation easily, though not necessarily quickly. There are other modules
 that can do a small subset of these operations quicker, so if speed is a
 primary issue, you should look elsewhere.

Description-en: Development files for double-array trie library
 Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with
 O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as hashing,
 trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
 manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
 spelling dictionaries.

Description-en: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS
 DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver with a self-contained relational database
 management system. It embeds a small and fast embedded SQL database engine
 called SQLite (see sqlite3) into a DBI driver. It is useful if you want a
 relational database for your project, but don't want to install a large
 RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92 (<URL:http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>)
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform a global
 lock on the entire database. This, obviously, might not be good for multiple
 user systems. The database also appears to be significantly faster if your
 transactions are coarse.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Package: libdevel-cover-perl
Description-md5: 14aa017ee7cc6570ae7dd3bfb556e39c
Description-en: Perl tool for determining code coverage metrics
 Devel::Cover is a Perl module that helps collect and display code coverage
 information. Code coverage information is collected using a pluggable runops
 function which counts how many times each op is executed. This data is then
 mapped back to reality using the B compiler modules. There is also a another
 statement profiler which needs a better backend to be really useful.
 .
 Statement, branch, condition, subroutine, pod and time coverage information is
 reported. Statement coverage data should be reasonable, although there may be
 some statements which are not reported. Branch and condition coverage data
 should be mostly accurate too, although not always what one might initially
 expect. Subroutine coverage should be as accurate as statement coverage. Pod
 coverage comes from Pod::Coverage. If Pod::Coverage::CountParents is available
 it will be used instead. Coverage data for path coverage are not yet
 collected.
 .
 The cover program can be used to generate coverage reports. Another included
 program, gcov2perl, can convert gcov files to Devel::Cover databases.

 Devel::Leak has two functions: NoteSV and CheckSV.
 .
 NoteSV walks the perl internal table of allocated SVs (scalar values) - (which
 actually  contains arrays and hashes too), and records their addresses in a
 table. It returns a count of these "things", and stores a pointer to the
 table (which is obtained from the heap using malloc()) in its argument.
 .
 CheckSV is passed argument which holds a pointer to a table created by
 NoteSV. It re-walks the perl-internals and calls sv_dump() for any "things"
 which did not exist when NoteSV was called. It returns a count of the number
 of "things" now allocated.

 and Devel::StackTraceFrame.  The goal of this object is to encapsulate
 the information that can found through using the caller() function, as
 well as providing a simple interface to this data.
 .
 The Devel::StackTrace object contains a set of Devel::StackTraceFrame
 objects, one for each level of the stack.  The frames contain all the
 data available from caller() as of Perl 5.6.0 though this module still
 works with 5.00503.

 SONAMEs of the same library can safely co-exist in the same symbol space.
 Shared library dependencies are also checked for compatibility.

Description-en: X11 Distributed Multihead library (debug package)
 libdmx is an interface to the DMX extension for X, which allows a single
 server to be set up as a proxy spanning multiple servers -- not unlike
 Xinerama across discrete physical machines.  It can be reconfigured
 on the fly to change the layout, and it is presented as a single logical
 display to clients.
 .
 libdmx allows clients to configure the layout of DMX servers by adding
 and removing screens, input devices, et al.
 .
 This package contains the debug versions of the library found in libdmx1.
 Non-developers likely have little use for this package.

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Description-md5: 1c14f34a9b9d859825a55e14b46d6c7c
Description-en: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world is still byte
 based. Programs therefore needs to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arrange for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description-en: functional constraint library implemented in Objective Caml
 FaCiLe is a constraint programming library over integer finite domain
 written in Objective Caml. It offers all usual facilities to create
 and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions and
 constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints and
 search goals. FaCiLe allows as well to build easily user-defined
 constraints and goals (including recursive ones), making pervasive use
 of OCaml higher-order functionals to provide a simple and flexible
 interface for the user. As FaCiLe is an OCaml library and not "yet
 another language", the user benefits from type inference and strong
 typing discipline, high level of abstraction, modules and objects
 system, as well as native code compilation efficiency, garbage
 collection and replay debugger, all features of OCaml (among many
 others) that allow to prototype and experiment quickly: modeling, data
 processing and interface are implemented with the same powerful and
 efficient language.

 user (typicaly your user) and to solve the various issues that arise trying to
 find them consistently across a wide variety of platforms.
 .
 The end result is a single API that can find your resources on any platform,
 making it relatively trivial to create Perl software that works elegantly and
 correctly no matter where you run it.

Package: libfile-listing-perl
Description-md5: 2ae02de0eba22eeba98280c10ba05d83
Description-en: module to parse directory listings
 File::Listing exports a single function called parse_dir(), which can be used
 to parse directory listings.
 .
 The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse. It can
 be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
 representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.
 .
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed.
 .
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

Description-en: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Package: libiec61883-0
Description-md5: d95e7f2402ce60a8f77bf09c3802a2c7
Description-en: an partial implementation of IEC 61883
 This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug
 registers, and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6
 (AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all FireWire multimedia devices use IEC
 61883 protocols.
 .
 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Description-en: library for accessing the Irman Infra Red hardware
 libirman is a library that allows access to Irman Infra Red hardware from
 Linux and other Unix systems.
 .
 For general application programming, the preferred interface for infra-red
 control is `lirc', as lirc supports multiple programs sharing the same
 infra-red receiver.  It does this by providing a socket based interface to
 which several programs can connect.
 .
 lirc uses libirman to interface with the Irman Infra Red hardware, so in
 single use applications directly using libirman is simpler and uses less
 system resources.  Currently, lirc only works on Linux systems, so programs
 written using libirman directly are more portable.
 .
 NOTE: This debian package is mainly provided so that Irman support can be
 enabled in lirc package and there is no libirman0 because upstream doesn't
 build a shared library.

 JSON is a Perl module for manipulating data stored in the format of the same
 name. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a simple data serialization format
 (defined in RFC 4627) that serves as an alternative to XML.
 .
 The primary purpose of this module is to select an appropriate backend JSON
 implementation. It prefers either JSON::XS (see libjson-xs-perl) or JSON::PP
 (see libjson-pp-perl), but will fall back on a backport implementation if
 neither are available.

Package: libjson-pp-perl

Description-en: module for manipulating JSON-formatted data (Pure Perl)
 JSON::PP is a module for manipulating data stored in the JavaScript Object
 Notation (JSON) serialization format (defined in RFC 4627), which serves as
 an alternative to XML.
 .
 This Pure Perl JSON implementation will become a core module beginning with
 perl 5.13, and will be loaded by the JSON module (see libjson-perl) if the
 C/XS-accelerated version (see libjson-xs-perl) is not available.

Package: libjson-xs-perl
Description-md5: a35c37101459f7bb513bbecae42cf3f5
Description-en: module for serializing/deserializing JSON
 JSON::XS is a Perl module for converting arbitrary Perl data structures to
 JSON and vice versa. Its primary objectives are to be semantically correct
 and to run quickly; for the latter goal, the implementation is written in C.
 .
 From JSON version 2.0 onward, the JSON module will use JSON::XS to accelerate
 its work, with no overhead due to emulation (by inheriting the constructor
 and methods). Using JSON instead of JSON::XS gives you a portable JSON API
 that can be fast when needed, but doesn't require a C compiler by falling
 back on a Pure Perl implementation.

Package: liblog-log4perl-perl
Description-md5: 4b9ac0ee8b1b5df3d70cdcffcd8ce039
Description-en: A Perl port of the widely popular log4j logging package.
 Log::Log4perl is a pure Perl port of the widely popular Apache/Jakarta
 log4j library for Java. In the spirit of log4j, Log::Log4perl
 addresses the shortcomings of typical ad-hoc or homegrown logging
 systems by providing three mechanisms to control the amount of data
 being logged and where it ends up at:
    * Levels allow you to specify the priority of log
      messages. Low-priority messages are suppressed when the system's
      setting allows for only higher-priority messages.
    * Categories define which parts of the system you want to enable
      logging in. Category inheritance allows you to elegantly reuse
      and override previously defined settings of different parts in the
      category hierarchy. So, at a central location in your system (either
      in a configuration file or in the startup code) you may specify which
      components (classes,functions) of your system should generate logs.
    * Appenders allow you to choose which output devices the log data
      is being written to, once it clears the previously listed
      hurdles.

 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.

 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many ouput  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.

Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems - library
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

Description-en: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors

 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need https support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Package: libppi-perl
Description-md5: 65e8ee936b1f6025105595702eb5063b
Description-en: module to parse, analyze and manipulate Perl code
 PPI provides the ability to parse, analyze and manipulate Perl code without
 actually executing the code, by implementing a lexer similar to what perl has
 itself internally.
 .
 The purpose of PPI is not to parse Perl Code, but to parse Perl Documents. By
 making this distinction and treating the problem this way, one could analyze
 files containing Perl source code in isolation from any other resources and
 without executing it, including other libraries. A significant feature of PPI
 is the ability to analyze Perl source code without requiring an instance of
 perl to run alongside or inside the parser.

 name with "PPIx::Utilities", e.g. functionality related to PPI::Nodes is in
 PPIx::Utilities::Node.

 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the development headers and static libraries needed for
 writing C++ applications.

Package: libreadonly-perl
Description-md5: b7b346189e6c11c18015c43e895af85e
Description-en: facility for creating read-only scalars, arrays and hashes
 Readonly is a facility for creating non-modifiable variables.
 This is useful for configuration files, headers, etc.
 It can also be useful as a development and debugging tool, for catching
 updates to variables that should not be changed.

Package: libreadonly-xs-perl
Description-md5: d9bea8df5ae850ca5b0316c219f99452
Description-en: Faster Readonly implementation
 The Readonly module (q.v.) is an effective way to create non-modifiable
 variables. However, it's relatively slow.
 .
 The reason it's slow is that is implements the read-only-ness of variables via
 tied objects. This mechanism is inherently slow. Perl simply has to do a lot
 of work under the hood to make tied variables work.
 .
 This module corrects the speed problem, at least with respect to scalar
 variables. When Readonly::XS is installed, Readonly uses it to access the
 internals of scalar variables. Instead of creating a scalar variable object
 and tying it, Readonly simply flips the SvREADONLY bit in the scalar's FLAGS
 structure.

Package: librelp-dev
Description-md5: 42c1d0b6aeb68e5586482de4937a9e25
Description-en: Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) library - development files
 RELP provides reliable event logging over the network.
 .
 RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
 connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version of
 RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
 session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few messages
 may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future
 versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.
 .
 Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even
 though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
 communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs
 provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing
 applications.

Package: libtask-weaken-perl
Description-md5: fdcaac07be2735b1155386311147ccdc
Description-en: Ensure that a platform has weaken support
 One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's weaken function is
 that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.
 .
 While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based Perl
 environment, some operating system distributions only include the pure-Perl
 versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then "missing" from
 the platform, despite passing a dependency on Scalar::Util successfully.
 .
 Most notably this is RedHat Linux at time of writing, but other come and go
 and do the same thing, hence "recurring problem".
 .
 The normal solution is to manually write tests in each distribution to ensure
 that weaken is available.

 the result you were expecting. At it's simplest it compares two structures by
 going through each level, ensuring that the values match, that arrays and
 hashes have the same elements and that references are blessed into the correct
 class. It also handles circular data structures without getting caught in an
 infinite loop.
 .
 Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do something besides
 simple exact comparisons. With strings, the eq operator checks that 2 strings
 are exactly equal but sometimes that's not what you want. When you don't know
 exactly what the string should be but you do know some things about how it
 should look, eq is no good and you must use pattern matching instead.

 In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This modules causes any
 warnings to be captured and stored. It automatically adds an extra test that
 will run when your script ends to check that there were no warnings. If there
 were any warings, the test will give a "not ok" and diagnostics of where, when
 and what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was going on when
 the it occurred.
 .
 If some of your tests are supposed to produce warnings then you should be
 capturing and checking them with Test::Warn, that way Test::NoWarnings will
 not see them and so not complain.

 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4lconvert offers functions to convert from any (known) pixelformat
 to BGR24, RGB24, YUV420 and YVU420.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 .
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 .
 This package contains development files (headers and static libraries).

Description-en: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Package: libxml-parser-perl
Description-md5: f3f996bbf5ff035cbc02bffeda96694b
Description-en: Perl module for parsing XML files
 XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on top
 of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
 Clark's expat library.  Each call to one of the parsing methods
 creates a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to
 parse the document.  Expat options may be provided when the
 XML::Parser object is created.  These options are then passed on to
 the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be given as extra
 arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or
 Handlers options, or by setHandlers method.  These all provide
 mechanisms for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by
 XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither Style nor Handlers are specified,
 then parsing just checks the document for being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
 parameter the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description-md5: 85b6ca7554a3537b49500d73d818d9b6
Description-en: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Package: libxml-sax-writer-perl
Description-md5: 9162abd02009c1134cce2671337f9586
Description-en: Perl module for a SAX2 XML writer
 XML::SAX::Writer helps to serialize SAX2 representations of XML documents to
 strings, files, and other flat representations. It handles charset encodings,
 XML escaping conventions, and so forth. It is still considered alpha,
 although it has been put to limited use in settings such as XML::LibXML and
 the AxKit XML Application Server.

Package: libxml-simple-perl
Description-md5: 9205d4b838f0b9ba0b4731da4e97a76d
Description-en: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.

Package: libxml-twig-perl
Description-md5: 57b0c694882ee9f6f587f4f1a19451b2
Description-en: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

 the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System.
 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
 either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the
 server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this
 extension to X clients.
 .
 This package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
 useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
 facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
 programs using this library (or the library itself).  The library is
 installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be debugged is
 executed.  Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.

Description-en: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and
 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM
 uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC, or it can emit C code.
 .
 LLVM is the key component of the clang compiler and the gcc plugin called
 dragonegg.

Description-en: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM), libraries and headers
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and
 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM
 uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the libraries and headers to develop applications
 using llvm.

 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC, or it can emit C code.
 .
 LLVM is the key component of the clang compiler and the gcc plugin called
 dragonegg.

Package: lmodern
Description-md5: 791a81d702e358fbb7c58c9627c081c0
Description-en: scalable PostScript and OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern
 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of
 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).
 .
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program
 based on MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and
 they are usually considered to be of good quality (compared to
 cm-super, for instance; however, cm-super contains font families
 that have no equivalent in this package; additionally, there are
 character sets that are supported by cm-super and not by the Latin
 Modern fonts).
 .
 The fonts are setup for use with the TeX typesetting system. They
 are also registered with defoma, which makes them available to other
 applications such as Ghostscript and Fontconfig. Finally, they are
 made available to the core X11 fonts system, which makes it possible
 to use them in any X application.

Package: logrotate
Description-md5: bb73169bb75b2b8a2fda1453d214416d
Description-en: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.

Package: logtail
Description-md5: a844125a20d0a40064a9bb3cc49d8c48
Description-en: Print log file lines that have not been read (deprecated)
 This program will read in a standard text file and create an
 offset marker when it reads the end. The offset marker is read
 the next time logtail is run and the text file pointer is moved
 to the offset location. This allows logtail to read in the next
 lines of data following the marker. This is good for marking log
 files for automatic log file checkers to monitor system events.
 .
 The package also provides logtail2, which better deals with rotated log
 files: If logtail2 finds that the inode of the file was changed, it assumes
 that the log has been rotated, and tries to find the file it was rotated to
 using heuristic plugins. If it finds the file, it will print the remainder of
 the file starting at the offset saved to the offset file. If a file with the
 correct inode was not found, logtail2 will only print the new file in its
 entirety before writing a new offset file.

Package: logwatch
Description-md5: ece539a8a87c5f861d7f0b865e42a03c
Description-en: log analyser with nice output written in Perl
 Logwatch is a modular log analyser that runs every night
 and mails you the results. It can also be run from command line.
 .
 The output is by service and you can limit the output to one particular
 service. The subscripts which are responsible for the output, mostly
 convert the raw log lines in structured format.
 .
 Logwatch generally ignores the time component in the output, that means,
 you will know that the reported event was logged in the requested range of
 time, but you will have to go to the raw log files to get the exact details.

Package: lokalize
Description-md5: fb65e1340bca6ad2b951b8e6a11b17fa
Description-en: computer-aided translation system
 Lokalize is a computer-aided translation system that focuses on productivity

 capability. It is primarily targeted at software translation and also
 integrates external conversion tools for office document translation.
 Lokalize is a replacement of KBabel.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE Software Development Kit module.

Package: lp-solve
Description-md5: bc9fbd53b2b145f26b30729410336710
Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

 macro language and as an extension to the typesetting
 engine itself. A (growing) number of TeX internals are
 made available to the embedded lua interpreter.
 .
 LuaTeX uses code and interfaces from Aleph to improve the
 typesetting of non-latin alphabet languages, instead of
 the TeXXeT code present in the current releases of pdfTeX.
 .
 Unicode and OpenType font support are added progressively,
 and regular pdfTeX development will continue in this
 branch as well.
 .
 The multi-lingual extensions are coded and merged by Taco
 Hoekwater. Swift progress in that area is made possible
 by a joint grant from Colorado State University and TUG,
 under the 'Oriental TeX' project.
 .
 This package only contains the barebone binary. If you are
 searching for support file, formats etc install texlive-luatex.

Description-en: Helper tools for including Maven metadata in Debian packages
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 This package enables Debian packages which are not using Maven in their
 build process to provide and install Maven POMs and libraries in the
 repository located in /usr/share/maven-repo.
 .
 Packages built with Maven (using maven-debian-helper) will benefit as
 many of their dependencies are already packaged in Debian but they are
 missing the necessary metadata (Maven POM) which is required by Maven
 when it is using dependencies.

Description-md5: 34e9c00f37885dbcdfb61296f24c84df
Description-en: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.

 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.

 This package contains the documentation for the pinentry packages,
 a suite of programs that allow secure entry of PINs or pass phrases.
 If you have one of the pinentry packages installed then you may want
 to install this package as well, but the documentation mostly concerns
 the internal protocol and is therefore not necessary for the casual
 user.

Package: pinentry-gtk2
Description-md5: bcccd74b65983a22e87d3cf912f42450
Description-en: GTK+-2-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the GTK+ tool kit version 2, so it is especially suitable for
 users of GNOME.  If the X Window System is not active then an
 alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There are sibling packages
 that implement PIN entry dialogs using other tool kits.

Package: pinentry-qt4
Description-md5: e209db6061c349efb79d0502a6ced376
Description-en: Qt-4-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for entry of PINs or pass
 phrases.  It is useful for entering pass phrases when using encryption
 software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using the same.  It uses an open
 protocol and is therefore not tied to particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the Qt tool kit version 4, so it is especially suitable for
 users of KDE 4.  If the X Window System is not active then an
 alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other tool kits.

Package: pitivi
Description-md5: 23faa5d2e5b4845d687103b38e1a43fd
Description-en: non-linear audio/video editor using GStreamer
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 PiTiVi allows users to easily edit audio/video projects based on the
 GStreamer framework.  PiTIVi provides several ways of creating and
 modifying a timeline.  Ranging from a simple synopsis view (a-la
 iMovie) to the full-blown editing view (aka Complex View) which puts
 you in complete control of your editing.

 built source tree and adds it to debian/files.
 .
 This package diverts and wraps debhelper's dh_strip. It automatically
 calls pkg_create_dbgsym for all packages dh_strip is asked to act on.
 As a result, by merely installing this package on buildds, all
 packages will automatically get ddebs built.

Package: pkg-kde-tools
Description-md5: 44a8f370c27342159273ca4a80210c3b
Description-en: various packaging tools and scripts for KDE Applications
 This package contains a variety of packaging tools and build scripts that may
 be very useful when packaging KDE applications. Even if you are a maintainer
 of a very small KDE application, this package should be worthwhile checking
 out.
 .
 Main highlights:
  - recommended build flags for building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - cdbs class for building packages based on the KDE Platform (kde.mk);
  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.
 .
 NOTE: since this package is cumulative, it does not depend on the packages it
 provides helpers for. I.e. you still need to explicitly build depend on
 debhelper or cdbs in your packages.

Package: pkgbinarymangler
Description-md5: 160cf93e8071fea98eda367aac3b734d
Description-en: strips translations and alters maintainers during build
 pkgbinarymangler consists of a dpkg-deb wrapper that calls the following
 helper applications while building a debian binary package:
 .
 pkgstriptranslations removes all *.mo files in /usr/share/locale from
 all package build directories. It is used to strip off gettext translations
 from generated binary packages, because translations are already shipped
 in the language packs.  Its behaviour (which is disabled by default) is
 configured in /etc/pkgbinarymangler/striptranslations.conf.
 .
 pkgmaintainermangler adjusts the maintainer field in binary packages to
 match a set of rules (including whitelists, mass renames by component,
 maintainer name, etc) defined in the pkgmaintainermangler configuration
 file at /etc/pkgbinarymangler/maintainermangler.conf.

Package: pngquant
Description-md5: 1d0769779d5bab0eb300ce90eee9ee09
Description-en: PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image optimising utility
 pngquant is a command-line conversion utility to quantize and dither truecolor
 PNG images, especially those with a full alpha channel, down to 8-bit (or
 smaller) RGBA-palette PNGs. Such images are usually two to four times smaller
 than the full 32-bit versions, and partial transparency is preserved quite
 nicely. This makes pngquant especially useful both for Web sites and for
 PlayStation 2 development, where one of the texture formats is
 RGBA-palette-based (though not PNG-compressed).
 This is the same technique used for many of the images on the Miscellaneous
 Transparent PNGs page (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngs-img.html), and
 the results are often indistinguishable from the original, truecolor PNG
 images.
 .
 Optimizers (like pngcrush and optipng) optimize the compression, usually
 losslessly, while pngquant quantizes colors down to 256 (or fewer) distinct
 RGBA combinations, which is lossy.

  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through KDE)
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the

 a script which is linked via the alternatives subsystem to
 /usr/sbin/update-rc.d. This script looks for a local policy-rc.d
 script in /usr/local and /etc, providing a policy- and FHS-compliant
 way to interface invoke-rc.d with a local script.
 .
 Without this package, a local admin wanting to cleanly interface with
 invoke-rc.d is forced to drop a local binary to /usr/sbin and/or
 manually interface with the alternatives system. Both ways of doing
 this are clumsy and error-prone, so this package offers a clean way of
 interfacing with sysvrc and file-rc.
 .
 Since there are at least two packages containing their own version of
 invoke-rc.d, having a search path policy for policy-rc.d can be
 messy and is prone to be unstructured and uncoordinated.
 .
 Hence, having a dedicated package is the clean way of doing things.
 .
 This package has its upstream sources maintained in the Debian
 project, so there is no upstream URL.

 alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program.  Postfix attempts to
 be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
 sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside
 has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.
 This provides support for CDB (constant database) maps in Postfix. If you
 plan to use CDB maps with Postfix, you need this.

 Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special
 postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous results on
 printers.  EPS files are needed for including (scalable) graphics
 into TeX (or even Word) documents.  Other programs like ps2epsi do
 not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are
 put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript
 code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some parts of
 the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the
 correct bounding box.

Package: python-egenix-mxdatetime
Description-md5: e3102cb577c19b97097313b6b22ad8ea
Description-en: date and time handling routines for Python
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new
 objects, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you
 store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
 using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation
 used by Python's time module).
 .
 You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle and copy
 them and convert the results to strings, COM dates, ticks and some
 other more esoteric values. In addition, there are several convenient
 constructors and formatters at hand to greatly simplify dealing with
 dates and times in real-world applications.
 .
 In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the package
 also exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to
 build upon. This is especially interesting for database applications
 which often have to deal with date/time values (the mxODBC package is
 one example of an extension using this interface).
 .
 mxDateTime can convert between various different date/time storage
 formats, including COM dates, TJD, MJD, JDN, tuples and, probably
 most important, strings.
 .
 The date/time parser included in mxDateTime is one of the most
 flexible such parser available for Python. It is constantly being
 improved to make parsing date/time strings as easy as possible. At
 the same time, it offers a fully customizable interface which allows
 selecting valid date/time formats from a range of predefined
 categories.
 .
 There are also special parser and formatter modules for ARPA and ISO
 date/time formats, which are handy if you work a lot with Internet
 standards.

Description-md5: 6bad8622d37501dcf6bd08a55e4f9fb9
Description-en: Module to access and modify configuration data in INI files
 iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:
 .
  * Compatible with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations of
    ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included that are
    API-compatible with the Python standard library. They pass all the unit
    tests in Python-2.4.4.
 .
  * Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options, indentation,
    comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as possible when data is
    updated.
 .
  * More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation
    (cfg.user.name), or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).
 .
 It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by
 programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config file
 completely rearranged whenever a program changes it. iniparse also allows
 making the order of entries in a config file significant, which is desirable
 in applications like image galleries.

 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 based on the OS capabilities for an atomic filesystem operation.
 These implementations are also available for explicit use as
 ‘LinkFileLock’ and ‘MkdirFileLock’.
 .
 Other back ends are possible with the same semantics; an example
 provided is ‘SQLiteFileLock’.
 .
 Unlike other Python locking libraries (the Windows ‘msvcrt.locking’
 function, the Unix ‘fcntl.flock’, ‘fcntl.lockf’, and the deprecated
 ‘posixfile’ module), the API is identical across both Unix (including
 GNU/Linux and MacOS) and Windows platforms.

Package: python-protobuf
Description-md5: 4080014e9f8176a470b7b9bb1ada860f
Description-en: Python bindings for protocol buffers
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.
 .
 This package contains both the traditional Python-based
 implementation and the new C++-based one, and you can select at
 runtime between the two.

 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asycronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.

Description-en: SVG scrubber and optimizer
 Scour is a Python module that aggressively cleans SVG files, removing a lot of
 unnecessary information that certain tools or authors embed into their
 documents.  The goal of scour is to provide an identically rendered image
 (i.e. a scoured document should have no discernable visible differences from
 the original file) while minimizing the file size.
 .
 WARNING: Scour is intended to be run on files that have been edited in Vector
 Graphics editors such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.  Scour attempts to
 optimize the file, and as result, it will change the file's structure and
 (possibly) its semantics.  If you have hand-edited your SVG files, you will
 probably not be happy with the output of Scour.
 .
 Never use scour to overwrite your original file!
 .
 This package also provides a dh_scour debhelper extension which optimizes all
 shipped SVGs during package build. If python-rsvg and python-cairo are
 available, it will also do a before/after comparison and discard the optimized
 image if they differ by more than 0.05%.

Description-md5: 304b4f5d471b523d00f34c7c91faec22
Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Package: python-swift
Description-md5: de070055ceecd087c69ec8d278884c43
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Description-en: Full virtualization on i386 and amd64 hardware
 Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual PCs, each running unmodified Linux or
 Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a
 network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.
 .
 KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
 Linux hosts on x86 (32 and 64-bit) hardware.
 .
 KVM is intended for systems where the processor has hardware support for
 virtualization, see below for details.  All combinations of 32-bit and 64-bit
 host and guest systems are supported, except 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts.
 .
 KVM requires your system to support hardware virtualization, provided by AMD's
 SVM capability or Intel's VT. To find out if your processor has the necessary
 support:
 .
   egrep "flags.*:.*(svm|vmx)" /proc/cpuinfo
 .
 If it prints anything, the processor provides hardware virtualization
 support and is suitable for use with KVM.  Without hardware support, you can
 use qemu emulation instead.
 .
 KVM consists of two loadable kernel modules (kvm.ko and either kvm-amd.ko or
 kvm-intel.ko) and a userspace component. This package contains the userspace
 component, and you can get the kernel modules from the standard kernel images.
 .
 This package contains support for running virtualized and emulated x86 and
 x86-64 machines only.  Support for other architectures is provided by the
 qemu-linaro source package.
 .
 For network booting and installation of VMs, install the ipxe package which
 provides the boot roms.

 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a package received
 as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The stacked
 organization is proven to be efficient for the management of very large patch
 sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
 for Linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch, is the
 original author), and its main use by the current upstream maintainer is to
 manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made for the SUSE
 distribution.

Description-en: APT based installer using PackageKit's session DBus API
 Sessioninstaller allows applications to easily install additional software
 (e.g. extensions or GStreamer codecs), uninstall files and perform simple
 software status queries by implementing the distribution neutral
 D-Bus session interface of PackageKit.
 .
 The whole process including confirmation, error reporting and progress
 and notification is handled by sessioninstaller.
 .
 The reference implementation of the D-Bus interface can be found in
 gnome-packagekit. It was also adpoted by KPackageKit.
 .
 In contrast to gnome-packagekit and KPackageKit it doesn't use the PackageKit
 daemon for querying and installation, but instead makes use of APT and
 aptdaemon (alternatively synaptic can be used).

Package: setserial
Description-md5: 9bf5524b0c67673f200677dbc3c02151
Description-en: controls configuration of serial ports
 Set and/or report the configuration information associated with
 a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and which IRQ
 a particular serial port is using.
 .
 This version has a completely new approach to configuration, so if you
 have a setup other than the standard ttyS0 and 1, you will have to get
 your hands dirty.
 .
 By default, only COM1-4 are configured by the kernel, using IRQ 3 and 4.
 If you have other serial ports (such as an AST Fourport card), or
 if you have mapped the IRQs differently (perhaps COM3 and 4 to other
 IRQs to allow concurrent access with COM1 and 2) then you must have this
 package.

 A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
 Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and
 plain ASCII (currently via w3m by default) from a single source with
 other recommended and suggested packages; due to the flexible nature
 of SGML, many other target formats are possible.
 .
 This tool can not handle DocBook XML yet.  For DocBook SGML only.
 .
 HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package,
 but for the other formats the appropriate packages have to be installed.
 You need to install lynx or w3m for ASCII text output (w3m is the default
 txt backend).  Also jadetex is required for PS and PDF, and
 linuxdoc-tools for ld2db conversion.
 .
 This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation,
 an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents.  However, there is
 nothing Linux-specific about this package; it can be used for many
 other types of documentation on many other systems.  It should be
 useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation.
 .
 The package was formerly called linuxdoc-sgml because it originates
 from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  The name has been changed
 into sgmltools to make it clearer that there is no Linux-specific
 stuff included in this package.
 .
 This is the latest version of the sgmltools series and the successor of
 sgmltools v2.

Description-md5: 7de15bde951264e5f9603202d2a74a72
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Package: ttf-sil-gentium
Description-md5: f21607c108bcd382d215cd98dc0cdc42
Description-en: extended Unicode Latin font ("a typeface for the nations")
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
 the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
 is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
 attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
 in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001)
 and TDC2003 (2003).
 .
 Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
 additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
 the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
 attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
 including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
 ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
 .
 Range          Description
 U+0020-U+007F  Basic Latin
 U+00A0-U+00FF  Latin-1 Supplement
 U+0100-U+017F  Latin Extended-A
 U+0180-U+021F  Latin Extended-B
 U+0222-U+0233  Latin Extended-B (continued)
 U+0250-U+02AD  IPA Extensions
 U+02B0-U+02FF  Spacing Modifier Letters
 U+0300-U+036F  Combining Diacritical Marks
 U+0370-U+03D5  Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)
 U+1E00-U+1EFF  Latin Extended Additional
 U+1F00-U+1FFF  Greek Extended
 U+2000-U+203A  General Punctuation (partial)
 U+2070-U+209F  Superscripts and Subscripts
 U+20A0-U+20CF  Currency Symbols (partial)
 U+2100-U+214F  Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
 .
 Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
 drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
 italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
 4.1.
 .
 GentiumAlt is an alternate font with flatter diacritics, specifically
 designed for languages using multiple accents.
 .
 The extended sources (Fontlab .vfb) for this font family are available
 in the source package and on the project website.

Package: ttf-sil-gentium-basic
Description-md5: 159244884de165ea93b297fff31642f4
Description-en: smart Unicode font families (Basic and Book Basic) based on Gentium
 Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font famililes based on the original
 Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly
 heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold
 italic set of fonts.
 .
 The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main
 Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1
 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended
 Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and
 punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future
 version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
 way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until
 the complete Gentium character set is finished.
 .
 There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still missing from
 the main Gentium family:
  * Bold
  * Bold Italic
  * The slightly-heavier Book family
  * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
  * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features Support for a few more recent
  * Additions to Unicode Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1
 .
 The font sources are available in the source package and directly on the
 upstream project website.

Package: ttf-sil-padauk
Description-md5: 7e7a68e367a5058b1b117317a949e1c0
Description-en: smart Unicode font for languages in Myanmar
 Padauk is a Myanmar font covering all currently used characters in the
 Myanmar block as specified in Unicode 5.1
 .
 The font is a smart font using a Graphite description.
 .
 The GDL source code for the description and the corresponding documentation
 is available on the website or in the source package (simply type "apt-get
 source" to download it).  In addition OpenType tables have been added.
 .
 The features of the font are complete coverage of Myanmar script (excluding
 unused characters U+1050..U+1059), Graphite smarts including line breaking
 rules, OpenType tables for use on Windows.
 .
 Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
    * Padauk
    * Padauk Bold

Package: ttf-sil-scheherazade
Description-md5: 6a8207d145d1833524ba78bcd9eb3c1b
Description-en: smart Unicode font for Arabic
 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as
 Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed
 for almost any Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
 issues.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using
 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     - Scheherazade Regular
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic
 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,
 which are not recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented
 using OpenType technology.

 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

Package: ttf-wqy-microhei
Description-md5: f4c0765492d42591fa5491f51751acbe
Description-en: A droid derived Sans-Seri style CJK font
 WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a Sans-Serif style (also known as Hei,
 Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality
 CJK outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback", "Droid
 Sans" and "Droid Sans Mono" released by Google Corp. This font package
 contains two faces, "Micro Hei" and "Micro Hei Mono", in form of a
 True-Type Collection (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e.
 GBK Hanzi, in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1
 are covered, with additional support to many other international
 languages such as Latin, Extended Latin, Hanguls and Kanas. The font
 file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most known CJK fonts.
 As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
 used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because both
 font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs,
 they are the excellent choices for desktop fonts.

Package: ttf-wqy-zenhei
Description-md5: 1e5c788bfbd34f18409a1ccd47e50c2b
Description-en: "WenQuanYi Zen Hei" A Hei-Ti Style (sans-serif) Chinese font
 WenQuanYi Zen Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif type) Chinese font.
 It was designed for general purpose text formatting and on-screen
 display of Chinese characters among many other languages. The embolden
 strokes of the font glyphs produces enhanced screen contrast, making
 it easier to read and recognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs further
 enhance on-screen performance, and can be enabled with the provided
 configuration files.
 .
 WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a fairly complete coverage of Chinese
 Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional forms.
 The total glyph number in this font is over 35,000, including over
 21,000 Chinese Hanzi. This font provides full coverage of GBK (CP936)
 charset, CJK Unified Ideographs, as well as the code-points needed
 for zh_CN, zh_SG, zh_TW, zh_HK, zh_MO, ja (Japanese) and ko (Korean)
 locales for fontconfig.
 .
 Starting from version 0.8, this font package provides two font families,
 i.e. the proportional "WenQuanYi Zen Hei", and the monospaced typeface
 named "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".

 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Package: udev
Description-md5: 2a0ce683ea15310e7ba291148124cb1e
Description-en: rule-based device node and kernel event manager
 udev is a collection of tools and a daemon to manage events received from
 the kernel and deal with them in user-space.  Primarily this involves
 creating and removing device nodes in /dev when hardware is discovered or
 removed from the system.
 .
 Events are received via kernel netlink messaged and processed according to
 rules in /etc/udev/rules.d and /lib/udev/rules.d, altering the name of the
 device node, creating additional symlinks or calling other tools and programs
 including those to load kernel modules and initialise the device.

 This package is a convenient way to install both the PCF bitmap
 version and the scalable TrueType outline version of GNU Unifont.
 It also installs a copy of unifont.hex and related files in
 /usr/share/unifont.

 GNU Unifont was designed to render something besides an empty box
 for each visible Unicode character in the Basic Multilingual Plane
 (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's modern writing scripts.
 This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

Package: valgrind
Description-md5: d217990d46a0fff26d9d2ce59a9cd419
Description-en: A memory debugger and profiler
 Valgrind is a GPL'd tool to help you find memory-management problems in your
 programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads and
 writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
 intercepted.
 .
 Valgrind can debug more or less any dynamically-linked ELF x86/Linux,
 amd64/Linux and ppc/Linux executables, without modification, recompilation,
 or anything.
 .
 Valgrind provides a generic infrastructure for supervising the execution of
 programs called "tools". This is done by providing a way to instrument
 programs in very precise ways, making it relatively easy to support
 activities such as dynamic error detection and profiling. The Valgrind
 distribution currently includes three tools: a memory error detectors, a
 cache (time) profiler and a heap (space) profiler.

 When vblade exports the block storage over AoE it becomes a storage
 target.  Another host on the same LAN can access the storage if it has
 a compatible aoe kernel driver.

Package: wget
Description-md5: 5236403933a6a468ee742f69c06e86c9
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description-en: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 This package is missing three fonts from the X.Org source archives
 because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,
 and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Luxi.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

Package: xfonts-unifont
Description-md5: 38ac189d3fac2ca98891370d4da5be03
Description-en: PCF (bitmap) version of the GNU Unifont
 This is a bitmap font in a standard X11 format.  The font provides
 a glyph for each visible code point (character) in the Unicode Basic
 Multilingual Plane (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's
 modern writing scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont), because
 that version is scalable to any point size.

Package: xfonts-utils

Package: xfpt
Description-md5: 4f18f0f9f6e01f72c3d25e523873f3ee
Description-en: generate XML from plain text
 xfpt is a program that reads a file of plain text that contains relatively
 simple markup, and outputs an XML file. It is intended to simplify the
 management of XML data. It is not a program that attempts to turn a plain text
 document into XML. Markup within text is introduced by ampersand characters,
 but is otherwise "soft". You can define what follows the ampersand, for
 example, &" to generate a "quote" element. There is also a macro facility that
 allows for higher level concepts such as chapters, displays, tables, etc.

Package: xfsdump
Description-md5: 8448ced317c37d3587808bf000f24a98
Description-en: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

Description-md5: c1e47d60a01948be9aae7a2a4f63a0fe
Description-en: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: ff95e4399e5ec034de6998347673eb73
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .
 More information about X.Org can be found at:

 This package is built from the X.org xserver module.

Package: xz-utils
Description-md5: ea97a558c8575aebbed2c11cbd20e0f2
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Package: yapps2
Description-md5: e0daec7e8417eea1a6ad27d120598d3d

 generates Python code.  There are several parser generator systems
 already available for Python, but this parser has different goals:
 Yapps is simple, very easy to use, and produces human-readable parsers.
 .
 It is not the fastest or most powerful parser.  Yapps is designed to be
 used when regular expressions are not enough and other parser systems
 are too much: situations where you might otherwise write your own
 recursive descent parser.
 .
 This package contains several upward-compatible enhancements to the
 original YAPPS source:
 .
     - handles recursive input ("include files")
     - better error reporting
     - reads input incrementally

Package: yui-compressor
Description-md5: bd069b00e0a22b6335e050845844bcb7
Description-en: JavaScript/CSS minifier
 The YUI Compressor is a JavaScript compressor which, in addition to removing
 comments and white-spaces, obfuscates local variables using the smallest
 possible variable name. This obfuscation is safe, even when using constructs
 such as 'eval' or 'with' (although the compression is not optimal is those
 cases) Compared to jsmin, the average savings is around 20%.
 .
 The YUI Compressor is also able to safely compress CSS files. The decision
 on which compressor is being used is made on the file extension (js or css).

Description-md5: 57f7c14f19468fc52304fe4ab153e8b1
Description-en: create a kernel to boot a PowerPC machine from Open Firmware
 This little program takes a PowerPC Linux kernel as an uncompressed
 ELF image file (usually called vmlinux or such) and adds boot code
 and possibly a ramdisk to create a compressed kernel image that
 can be booted directly from Open Firmware, thus eliminating the
 need for a second-stage bootloader such as yaboot or quik. This is
 especially useful on PowerPC sub-architectures which do not have a
 bootloader at all, but may also come in handy for install kernels,
 netboot systems, and the like.
