The HPLIP Launchpad.net site https://launchpad.net/hplip is available 
to get help, report bugs, make suggestions, discuss the HPLIP project 
or otherwise contact the HPLIP Team.

The Debian team values users reports, but we are busy, and so we
kindly ask you to access the upstream support facilities:

For end user support please "Ask a question" at the 
upstream hplip support site: 
   https://answers.launchpad.net/hplip/+addquestion

If you know that the bug you want to report is in the "upstream"
code then please file report in the upstream hplip bug tracking system:
   https://launchpad.net/hplip/+filebug

If you feel that the bug is one that other Debian users should
know about then you are welcome to file a report in the Debian BTS
as well.  Please keep in mind, however, that managing bug reports
is part of the maintainers' workload.
