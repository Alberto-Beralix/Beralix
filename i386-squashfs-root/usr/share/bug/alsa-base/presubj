If you know that the bug you want to report is in the "upstream"
code then please file a bug report in the ALSA bug tracking system
(on the web at https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug).

If you feel that the bug is one that other Debian users should
know about then you are welcome to file a report in the Debian BTS
as well.  Please keep in mind, however, that managing bug reports
is part of the maintainers' workload.
