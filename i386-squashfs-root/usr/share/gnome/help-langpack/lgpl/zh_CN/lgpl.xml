    <title>序言</title>
    
    <para>大多数软件许可证决意剥夺你的共享和修改软件的自由。相反，GNU 较宽松通用公共许可证力图保证你的共享和修改自由软件的自由——保证自由软件对所有用户是自由的。</para>

    <para>当我们谈到自由软件时，我们指的是自由而不是价格。我们的 GNU 通用公共许可证决意保证你有发布自由软件的自由(如果你愿意，你可以对此项服务收取一定的费用)；保证你能收到源程序或者在你需要时能够得到它；保证你能修改软件或将它的一部分用于新的自由软件；而且还保证你知道你能做这些事情。</para>

    <para>此许可证，较宽松通用公共许可证，适用于自由软件基金会以及那些决定使用此许可证的作者所特殊设计的软件包——特别是库。您也可以使用此许可证，但是我们建议您先根据下面的解释仔细考查一下究竟是此许可证还是传统的通用公共许可证较适合在任何特定用途中使用。</para>

    <para>当我们谈到自由软件时，我们指的是用途自由而不是价格。我们的 GNU 通用公共许可证决意保证你有发布自由软件的自由(如果你愿意，你可以对此项服务收取一定的费用)；保证你能收到源程序或者在你需要时能够得到它；保证你能修改软件或将它的一部分用于新的自由软件；而且还保证你知道你能做这些事情。</para>

    <para>为了保护你的权利，我们需要作出规定：禁止任何人不承认你的权利，或者要求你放弃这些权利。如果你修改了库或者发布了库的副本，这些规定就转化为你的责任。</para>

    <para>例如，如果你发布这样一个库的副本，不管是收费的还是免费的，你必须将你具有的一切权利给予你的接受者；你必须保证他们能收到或得到源程序；如果你把该库与某个程序进行连接，你必须把完整的目标文件提供给接受者，以使他们在修改了库并重新进行了编译之后可以重新与该库进行连接。并且将这些条款给他们看，使他们知道他们有这样的权利。</para>

    <para>我们采取两项措施来保护你的权利：(1) 我们对库以版权保护，(2) 我们为您提供了此许可证，它给你复制、发布和修改库的法律许可。</para>

    <para>为了保护发布者，我们需要清楚地让每个人明白，自由库没有担保。同时，如果由于其他某个人修改了库，并继续加以传播，我们需要它的接受者明白：他们所得到的并不是原来的版本。任何由其他人引入的任何问题，不应损害原作者的声誉。</para>

    <para>最后，任何自由软件不断受到软件专利的威胁。我们想要确保公司无法通过专利持有人的限制性许可证来限制自由软件的用户。因此，我们坚持库的任何版本所获得的任何专利许可都必须与此许可证所指定的完全自由用途相吻合。</para>

    <para>大多数 GNU 软件，包括某些库，都是由传统的 GNU 通用公共许可证所管理的。此协议，GNU 较宽松通用公共许可证，适用于某些特殊设计的库，因而与传统的 GNU 通用公共许可证有所不同。我们对特定的库使用这一许可是为了允许将这些库与非自由的程序链接在一起。</para>

    <para>当程序与库链接在一起的时候，不管是静态还是共享库，此二者的组合可以被称为结合的作品，或称原始库的派生作品。传统的 GNU 通用公共许可证仅当整个组合符合其自由条件时才允许这样链接。较宽松通用公共许可证则在将其它代码与库链接在一起时条件更为宽松。</para>

      We call this license the <quote>Lesser</quote> General Public License
      because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
      General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers
      Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These
      disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License
      for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
      certain special circumstances.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
      a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
      allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
      library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
      case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
      software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    </para>

    <para>
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
      free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
      non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
      operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
      system.
    </para>

    <para>
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
      users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
      linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
      that program using a modified version of the Library.
    </para>

    <para>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
      <quote>work based on the library</quote> and a <quote>work that uses the
      library</quote>.  The former contains code derived from the library,
      whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</title>

    <sect2 id="sect0" label="0">
      <title>Section 0</title>
      <para>
	This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
	program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
	other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
	this Lesser General Public License (also called <quote>this License</quote>).
	Each licensee is addressed as <quote>you</quote>.
      </para>

      <para>
	A <quote>library</quote> means a collection of software functions and/or data
	prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
	(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </para>

      <para>
	The <quote>Library</quote>, below, refers to any such software library or work
	which has been distributed under these terms.  A <quote>work based on the
	Library</quote> means either the Library or any derivative work under
	copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
	portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
	straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
	included without limitation in the term <quote>modification</quote>.)
      </para>	

      <para>
	<quote>Source code</quote> for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
	all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
	interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
	and installation of the library.
      </para>

      <para>
	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
	such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
	on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
	writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
	and what the program that uses the Library does.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="sect1" label="1">
      <title>Section 1</title>
      <para>
	You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
	complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
	you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
	appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
	all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
	warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
	Library.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
	and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
	fee.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="sect2" label="2">
      <title>Section 2</title>
      <para>
	You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
	<link linkend="sect1">Section 1</link> above, provided that 
	you also meet all of these conditions:

	<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">

	      You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices

	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
	      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
	      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
	      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
	      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
	      in the event an application does not supply such function or
	      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
	      its purpose remains meaningful.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
	      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
	      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
	      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
	      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
	      root function must still compute square roots.)
	    </para>
	      
	    <para>
	      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
	      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
	      it.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	      collective works based on the Library.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
	      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
	      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	      the scope of this License.
	    </para>

	</orderedlist>
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="sect3" label="3">
      <title>Section 3</title>

      <para>
	You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
	License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
	this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
	that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
	instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
	ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
	that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
	these notices.
      </para>

      <para>
	Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
	that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
	subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
	the Library into a program that is not a library.

    <sect2 id="sect4" label="4">
      <title>Section 4</title>
      
      <para>
	You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
	derivative of it, under <link linkend="sect2">Section 2</link>
	) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
	<link linkend="sect1">1</link> and 
	<link linkend="sect2">2</link> above provided that you accompany
	it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
	must be distributed under the terms of Sections <link linkend="sect1">1</link>
	and <link linkend="sect2">2</link> above on a
	medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </para>

      <para>
	If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
	from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
	source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
	distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="sect5" label="5">
      <title>Section 5</title>

      <para>
	A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
	Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
	linked with it, is called a <quote>work that uses the Library</quote>.  
	Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
	therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
	However, linking a <quote>work that uses the Library</quote> with the Library
	creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
	contains portions of the Library), rather than a <quote>work that uses the
	library</quote>.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
	<link linkend="sect6">Section 6</link> states terms for distribution 
	of such executables.
      </para>

      <para>
	When a <quote>work that uses the Library</quote> uses material from a 
	header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
	may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
	Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
	linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
	threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.	
      </para>

      <para>
	If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
	structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
	functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
	file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
	work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
	Library will still fall under <link linkend="sect6">Section 6</link>.)
      </para>

      <para>
	Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
	distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
	<link linkend="sect6">Section 6</link>.
	Any executables containing that work also fall under 
	<link linkend="sect6">Section 6</link>,
	whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

	As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.

	If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
	an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
	so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
	excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
	written in the body of this License.

	If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
	write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
	copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
	Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
	decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
	of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
