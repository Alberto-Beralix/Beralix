      <title>Clips vs files</title>
       <list>
        <item><p><em>Files</em> are data on your hard disk (videos, music, pictures, etc.) that can be accessed by <app>PiTiVi</app> and incorporated in your video editing project.</p></item>
        <item><p><em>Clips</em> are a visual representation of your files on the timeline. They represent the period of time they consume on the timeline and can be edited independently: each time you drag a file from the media library to the timeline, a new clip is created. As such, a file can be reused as much as you want to create any amount of different clips.</p></item>
       </list>
       <p>Since PiTiVi is a non-destructive editor, clips are edited, not files. As such, your files stay intact.</p>

      <title>Moving clips along the timeline</title>
       <p>You can move a clip within a layer or move it to a different layer.</p>
       <p>Click and drag a single clip to move it, and release the mouse button to place it. Dragging horizontally keeps the clip on the same layer, but dragging it vertically moves the clip to a different layer.</p>
       <p>To move multiple clips at the same time, use the <key>Ctrl</key> or <key>Shift</key> keys to select multiple clips. Selected clips do not need to be on the same layer. Then, drag the clips just as you would do for a single clip; their position relative to each other will be preserved.</p>

       <title>Using ripple editing while moving clips</title>
        <p>While dragging clips around in the timeline, you can use the <link xref="trimming">ripple technique</link> to move the <em>following</em> clips (the clips that start after the one you're directly editing) to fill the gap.</p>
        <steps>
         <item><p>Click and drag the clip you want to move, with the mouse button held down</p></item>
         <item><p>During the drag, hold down <key>Shift</key> on the keyboard</p></item>
         <item><p>Release the mouse button to end the drag operation, then release the <key>Shift</key> key.</p></item>
        </steps>
        <p>During the drag operation, if you changed your mind and only want to drag one clip at a time, just release the <key>Shift</key> key before you release the mouse button.</p>
