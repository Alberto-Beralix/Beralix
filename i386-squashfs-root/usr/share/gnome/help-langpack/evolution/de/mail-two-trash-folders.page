<title>Two Trash folders shown for the same account</title>

<p>You may have created another Trash folder to hold all your deleted email messages. This can happen when you use another email client together with Evolution.</p>

<p>Evolution's <gui>Trash</gui> folder is a <link xref="mail-search-folders">Search folder</link>. It does not really exist but simply displays all the messages that are marked for deletion in any folders of that account.</p>

<p>You can easily tell the two Trash folders apart by looking at their icons. The Evolution <gui>Trash</gui> folder has a special icon whereas the other physical Trash folder looks like any other folder.</p>

<note>
<p>Note that the <gui>Junk</gui> folder is also a search folder and may also appear twice.</p>
