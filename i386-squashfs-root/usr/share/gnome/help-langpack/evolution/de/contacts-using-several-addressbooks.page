<title>Using several address books</title>

<p>You can have multiple address books. For example, you might have one address book for work related contacts and one for private contacts. The side bar lists those address books, and you can select which address book is shown.</p>

<p>You can also use address books that are not on your computer, such as on the internet (e.g. Google) or in a local network (e.g. LDAP).</p>
