<p>Mail accounts can be added via <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui><gui>Mail Accounts</gui><gui style="button">Add</gui></guiseq>. The steps are mostly the same as for the <link xref="intro-first-run">First-Run Assistant</link>, except for not getting asked whether to import data from other applications or to restore from a backup file.</p>
<p>Mail accounts can be edited via <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui><gui>Mail Accounts</gui><gui style="button">Edit</gui></guiseq>. The following settings are available when editing an existing account:</p>

<!-- TODO:XINCLUDE: Quite ugly to copy this text into all account type's, but it's not really worth a separate topic page for it, plus it would make the intro-first-run.page even more complex. Maybe later replace this text by a single instance by doing some content sharing with xinclude and xpointer in the other mail-account-manage-*.page files and in intro-first-run.page. <include href="foo.xml" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> See gnome-user-docs module for example usage. Also see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=638866 -->
<p>Here you define your name and your email address.</p>
<p>Optionally you can make this account your default account (e.g. when writing emails), set a Reply-To email address (if you want replies to messages sent to a different address), and set an organization (the company where you work, or the organization you represent when you send email from this account).</p>
