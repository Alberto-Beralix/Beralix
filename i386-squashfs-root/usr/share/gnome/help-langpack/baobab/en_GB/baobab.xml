<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->

  <sect1 id="baobab-introduction"> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 

      <para><application>Disk Usage Analyser</application> is a graphical, menu-driven application to analyse disk usage in any Gnome environment. <application>Disk Usage Analyser</application> can easily scan either the whole filesystem tree, or a specific user-requested directory branch (local or remote).</para>
       <para>It also auto-detects in real-time any changes made to your home directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. <application>Disk Usage Analyser</application> also provides a full graphical treemap window for each selected folder.</para>

<!-- ================ Getting Started ================================ -->

<!-- ================ Treemaps ================================ -->

	</screenshot> 
      </figure>
    <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->
  
    
    <para>Figure shows an example of treemap's theory. Each node (as shown in the tree diagram) has a name (a letter) and an associated size (a number). The size of leaves may represent for instance the size of individual files, the size of non-leaf nodes is the sum of the sizes of its children.</para> 
    
    <para>The treemap is constructed via recursive subdivision of the initial rectangle. The size of each sub-rectangle corresponds to the size of the node. The direction of subdivision alternates per level: first horizontally, then vertically, etc. As a result, the initial rectangle is partitioned into smaller rectangles, such that the size of each rectangle reflects the size of the leaf. The structure of the tree is also reflected in the treemap, as a result of its construction. Colour and annotation can be used to give extra information about the leaves.</para>

	<note><para>Treemaps are very effective when size is the most important feature to be displayed.</para></note>
  </sect1>
  <!-- ================ Ringschart ================================ -->

  <sect1 id="baobab-ringschart"> 
  <title>Ring chart</title>

    <para><guilabel>Ring chart</guilabel> is a graphical representation of the disk usage by a concrete folder. When launching the application, the filesystem usage is displayed as can be seen in the next figure:</para>

    <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
    <figure id="baobab-filesystem_scan"> 
      <title>Disk Usage Analyser showing a ring chart with the file system usage</title>

	  </textobject> 
	</mediaobject> 
      </screenshot> 
    </figure>
    <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

    <para>When you start scanning a folder, the tree of subfolders is created and listed on the left side. Each row contains information for the name, how much space it is taking up (percentage and size in KB, MB or GB) and the number of items (adding files and directories). When this process is finished, the <guilabel>Ring chart</guilabel> is drawn on the right side. If you stop it before it has been completed, only a partial representation is done based on the directories whose usage was computed.</para>


    <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->

    </figure>
    <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->
    
    <para>The <guilabel>Ring chart</guilabel> is composed of a set of nested rings around a central circle. This circle symbolises the root folder of the partial tree (that is, the folder that the user has selected for scanning). Each ring represents a level in the partial tree, i.e. the subfolders of the root folder will be represented in the first ring, and deeper levels in the tree correspond to outer rings in the chart. Each subfolder is represented by a sector of the ring, its angle being proportional to the size of the folder's contents, and painted with a different colour to ease visualisation. Up to five levels can be drawn; in case that a folder in that last fifth level contains even more subfolders, this situation will be pointed by the presence of a black curve close to the edge of that folder's ring sector. When a folder with no further subfolders is selected to be the root of the partial tree, only the inner circle will be drawn. When the mouse pointer hovers one of the folders in the graphic, it will be highlighted and a tooltip will appear with information about its name and size. If there are any subfolders, small grey tooltips will appear, indicating their names. It's possible that not all of the subfolders' names are displayed, to avoid overlapping.</para>

    <para>You can go up and down the rows in the list (optionally expanding those with subfolders); the graphic representation will change using the selected folder as the root of the partial tree to be represented. The folders can also be navigated from the <guilabel>ring chart</guilabel> itself. If you left-click inside a folder, you'll move deeper by setting the root of the graphic to that folder. If you middle-click anywhere inside the <guilabel>ring chart</guilabel> frame you'll get the opposite behaviour, going back one step in the hierarchy.</para>

    <para>The percentage of its parent's radius that is used by a given folder is directly proportional to the relation between its own size and its parent's. It's easy to understand that the size of a folder is equal to or smaller than its parent's. Although only directories are shown in this graphical representation, files are taken into account to calculate the amount of space occupied by folders.</para>
