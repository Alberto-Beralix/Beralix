     <title>What is a Podcast?</title>
     
  <p>Podcasts are recorded programs, similar to radio programs, that are
  available on the internet and allow you to subscribe.  When you subscribe
  to a podcast in Banshee, each time a new program is released, Banshee
  will automatically download the podcast and allow you to listen to it.</p>
  
  <p>There are podcasts on almost any subject including music, movies, Linux,
  and more.  Search the internet using your favorite search engine with a 
  search term such as "movie podcast" and you will be presented with many 
  options to choose from.</p>

    <title>Add a Podcast</title>
  
  <p>To add a Podcast to Banshee you will first need to visit the podcast's
  home page on the internet in your browser.  Almost all podcasts will have a 
  button or link displayed to subscribe to the podcast.  Copy the link
  to the podcast's subscription.  In most web browsers, you can right click
  on the link and choose <gui>Copy link</gui>.
  </p>
  
  <p>In Banshee, press and choose <gui>Subscribe to Podcasts</gui> in the 
  upper right hand corner, from the menu choose <guiseq><gui>Media</gui><gui>
  Subscribe to Podcast</gui></guiseq> or use the keyboard shortcut <keyseq>
  <key>Shift</key><key>Control</key><key>F</key></keyseq>.
  </p>
  
  <p>Banshee will then allow you to choose how you want to download new podcasts
  from a drop down menu.  Your choices include:</p>
  
  <list>
  	<item><p>Download the Most Recent Episode (This will automatically
  	download the last episode that was released).</p></item>
  	<item><p>Download All Episodes (This will download all episodes).</p></item>
	<item><p>Let Me Decide Which Episodes to Download (This will allow you
	to choose which episodes you would like to download).</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>After you have added a Podcast feed, Banshee will display:</p>
  
  <list>
  	<item><p><gui>Name</gui>: (Name of the specific episode)</p></item>
  	<item><p><gui>Podcast</gui>: (Name of the Podcast)</p></item>
  	<item><p><gui>Published</gui> (Date the episode was published or released)</p></item>
  </list>
