  <title>Sources</title>
    <p>Your music and video sources are shown on the left in Banshee.  The
    sources give you quick access to your Play Queue, Music, Videos, Amazon,
    Last.fm, Podcasts and more.
    </p>
    
    <note style="tip">
      <p>The menu choices will change depending on the source you have chosen.
      For example, to use the menu to import a Podcast, you will need to choose
      the Podcast source.  The menu option for importing a Podcast is not
      available when viewing the video or music library.</p>

  <title>Library Browser</title>
  <p>When you select a music or video source from Sources, Banshee will 
  display your content in the Library browser.  Depending on the source
  you choose, Banshee can display your music or video library, Podcast
  subscriptions or even the Amazon Music Store to allow you to buy music.</p>

<section id="nowplaying">
  <title>Now Playing View</title>
  <p>Helpful when using Banshee in full screen mode, the Now Playing mode
  hides the library to give you a larger view of the music or video you're 
  watching.   When listening to music, the Now Playing view will show you 
  the artist name, album and cover art if available.  If you are watching
  a video, Banshee will display the video.</p>
  
  <p>To change Now Playing to hide the Banshee user interface and use the full
  screen mode, you can press the <key>F</key>, press the <gui>Fullscreen</gui> 
  button in the upper right hand corner of Banshee, or choose 
  <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Fullscreen</gui></guiseq> to start Fullscreen
  mode.</p>

<section id="library">
  <title>Library</title>
  <p>The Library view in Banshee will change depending on the Source you have 
  chosen.  The Music Library will display cover art, artists in your library, 
  and list of songs.  The Podcast Library will display your Podcast 
  subscriptions, podcasts that are downloaded or not downloaded, and all, new
  or old podcasts.  Please see each Source's help page for detailed information
  on managing a source.
