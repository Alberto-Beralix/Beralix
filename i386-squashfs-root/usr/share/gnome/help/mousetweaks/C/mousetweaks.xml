    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para><application>Mousetweaks</application> provides mouse accessibility
    enhancements for the GNOME Desktop. Indeed, it offers the following
    functions to the user:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Simulated secondary click: it allows the user to perform a
        secondary click (menu click) by holding down the primary mouse button
        while keeping the pointer motionless.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Dwell click: it allows the user to perform the various clicks
        without pressing any <hardware>hardware button</hardware>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Pointer capture: it allows the user to lock the pointer in a
        determined area of the panel until the user releases it by a
        predefined keystroke or mouse button.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>Since version 2.31.3, mousetweaks does not depend any more on the
      AT-SPI accessibility framework.</para>

  <sect1 id="mouse-a11y-how-to-start-features">
    <title>How To Start The Functions</title>

    <para>The simulated secondary click and the dwell click depend on the
    mousetweaks process; however the pointer capture applet depends on the
    GNOME panel. Consequently, also the methods to start them vary.</para>

    <sect2 id="mouse-a11y-start-ssc">

        displayed by the Dwell Click panel applet. In fact, this mouse icon is
        a dwellable On/Off button that provides feedback of the passing dwell
        time by filling its frame with another colour. When the frame is
        completely filled, the button displays its active state and the dwell

      <para>In order to add it to the panel, proceed as you do with any panel
      applet: perform a secondary click on the panel to open its contextual

      the window showing all the applets that can be installed on the GNOME
      panel.</para>

      <para>By double clicking on the <guilabel>Pointer Capture</guilabel>
      item in the Add to Panel window, the Pointer Capture applet will be

        <title>How Does It Work?</title>

        <para>Let us assume that the user has enabled the Simulated Secondary
        Click feature.</para>

        <para>To perform a simulated secondary click, the user has to keep the
        <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton> pressed without moving
        the pointer for the time determined by the delay slider of the
        Simulated Secondary Click feature. While the <mousebutton>primary
        mouse button</mousebutton> is kept pressed, the arrow of the pointer
        will be filled with a different color to give feedback about the
        passing time.</para>

        <para>If the user releases the <mousebutton>primary mouse
        button</mousebutton> before the arrow of the pointer has been
        completely filled with the new color, the system will only receive the
        information of the <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton>
        press and release.</para>

        <para>If the user releases the <mousebutton>primary mouse
        button</mousebutton> after the arrow of pointer has been completely
        filled with the new color, the <mousebutton>primary mouse
        button</mousebutton> events will be followed by a
        <mousebutton>secondary mouse button</mousebutton> click. In fact,
        mousetweaks creates this simulated <mousebutton>secondary mouse
        button</mousebutton> click as soon as the user releases the the
        <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton>.</para>

        <para>The explanations above assumed that the pointer did not move
        between the <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton> press and
        release. If the pointer gets moved before the <mousebutton>primary
        mouse button</mousebutton> is released, no simulated secondary click
        will be created. Consequently, to cancel an initiated secondary click,
        the user only has to move the pointer before releasing the
        <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton>.</para>

        <para>Moreover, the fact that the simulated secondary click is
        immediately preceded by a left click makes it behave differently than
        expected when the preceding left click has an incidence on the object
        that is to receive the simulated secondary click. Please, have a look
        at the section about the <link

        <para>People that have trouble to keep the pointer completely
        motionless can use the Motion Threshold slider of the Dwell Click
        feature. This setting makes mousetweaks ignore little mouse movements,
        so that the simulated secondary click is issued even if the pointer is
        not completely motionless. Please have a look at the section of the
        <link linkend="mouse-a11y-dwell-motion-treshold">Motion Threshold

        <title>Differences To The Normal Secondary Click</title>

        <para>As the Simulated Secondary Click does not discard
        the<mousebutton> primary mouse button</mousebutton> press and release,
        the resulting primary click occurs just before the secondary click
        created by mousetweaks. Consequently, the simulated secondary click
        behaves a bit differently than the normal secondary click, because the
        latter is usually not preceded immediately by a <mousebutton>primary
        mouse button</mousebutton> click. For example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>It is not possible to perform a secondary click on multiple
            items because the primary click issued before the secondary click
            deselects the items.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When performing a simulated secondary click on a link in a
            web page, the primary click, that precedes the simulated secondary
            click, opens the referenced page before the simulated secondary
            click has a chance to open the contextual menu of the link.</para>

            <tip>
              <para>The contextual menu of a link in a web page can be opened
              by performing a simulated secondary click while keeping the Ctrl
              modifier pressed. This works because the referenced page opens
              in a new tab when the link receives a primary click in
              conjunction with a pressed Ctrl modifier; which is also what
              happens as a side effect when opening the contextual menu of a
              link by using the simulated secondary click in conjunction with
              the Ctrl modifier.</para>

              <para>However the browser has to be configured to not
              automatically switch to the new tab when it opens; otherwise the
              page with the link disappears as the new tab becomes visible and
              the contextual menu does not appear.</para>

            the trash folder also opens. (The former is caused by the
            secondary click, the latter by the primary click preceding the

          <para>It is not possible to provide a list of all diverging

          receiving the secondary click preceded by a primary click.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Looking at it the other way, it is not possible to perform a
        long motionless <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton> press
        without also triggering the secondary click, unless the pointer is
        moved before the <mousebutton>primary mouse button</mousebutton>
        release. This may also have unexpected consequences for some users.
        For example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When releasing the primary button after keeping it pressed
            on the arrow of a scrollbar for more than the delay time, the
            scrollbar jumps to the bottom. This is in fact the normal
            behaviour of a secondary click on an arrow of a scrollbar.</para>

            <tip>
              <para>To avoid that the scrollbar jumps to the bottom, simply
              move the pointer away from the arrow of the scrollbar before
              releasing the primary button; this way, the initiated simulated
              secondary click gets cancelled.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>In the <guilabel>Capture Pointer</guilabel> section, the user
          can specify under what circumstances the pointer gets captured when
          it moves into the capture area. For example: if the control modifier
          is checked, the pointer gets captured when it is over the capture
          area and the user presses the Control modifier key. If no modifier
          is checked and the mouse button is set to 0, the pointer only has to
          move into the capture area to get locked.</para>

          <para>It is also possible to specify a combination of modifiers and
          mouse button.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>In the <guilabel>Release Pointer</guilabel> section, the user
          can specify what modifier or mouse button releases the
          pointer.</para>

          <para>It is also possible to specify a combination of modifiers and
