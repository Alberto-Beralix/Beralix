  <title>Reverse Connectionsâ€¦</title>

  <p>A reverse connection is usually used to bypass firewall restrictions on
  open ports. A firewall usually blocks open ports, but does not block outgoing
  traffic. In a normal forward connection, a client connects to a server through
  the server's open port, but in the case of a reverse connection, the client
  opens the port that the server connects to.</p>

    <p>The remote computer needs to connect to your machine using your IP
    address and port number, which are in the <gui>Reverse Connections...</gui>
    dialog, under <gui>Connectivity</gui>.</p>

    <note>
      <p>Currently, <app>Vino</app>, the GNOME VNC server, does not support
      reverse connections (also known as "listen mode"). Some other
      applications, such as <app>UltraVNC</app>, <app>RealVNC</app> and
      <app>TightVNC</app>, do have support for reverse connections.</p>
    </note>

    <p>Once the remote computer connects to your machine, <app>Vinagre</app>
    will establish the reverse connection.</p>

    <note>
      <p>When connecting to a machine which is not on your local network, you
      will need to provide your externally visible IP address and port number to
      the remote server.</p>
