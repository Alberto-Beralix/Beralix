 <title>Sync Addins</title>

	<p>Sync Addins allow you to choose different methods and places
	to sync your Tomboy notes.  For more information on configuring sync,
	visit the <link xref="sync-notes"/> help page.</p>


<section id="local">
  <title>Local Directory Sync Service</title>
  <p>The Local Directory Sync Service is enabled by default and allows
	Tomboy to sync its notes to another directory on your computer.
	This is helpful to create a backup of your notes.</p>
</section>

<section id="ssh">
  <title>SSH Sync Service</title>
  <p>The SSH Sync Service allows you to sync your notes with another computer
	via the SSH protocol.  This plugin is disabled by default.  You may
	need to install the <em>sshfs</em> package for your Linux distribution
	to make this addin work, which is outside the scope of this help 
	document.</p>
</section>

<section id="webdav">
  <title>WebDav Sync Service</title>
  <p>The WebDav Sync Service addin is enabled by default and allows you to
	sync your notes with a WebDav remote server.  You may need to have
	the <em>wdfs FUSE file system</em> package installed for your Linux
	distribution to make this addin work which is outside the scope of 
	this help document.</p>
</section>

<section id="webservice">
  <title>Web Sync Service</title>
  <p>The Web Sync Service addin allows you to sync your notes to a remote 
	web server or service, such as Tomboy Online.  At the time of writing, the Tomboy Online service has not launched.</p>
