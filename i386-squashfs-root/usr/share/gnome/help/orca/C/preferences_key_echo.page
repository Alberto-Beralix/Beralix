    <p>
      Orca's key echo setting controls what happens each time you press
      a key. To enable key echo, check the "Enable key echo" checkbox.
      Doing so causes additional checkboxes to become available through
      which you can choose exactly which keys should and should not be
      echoed to best suit your needs.

    <title>Enable echo by character</title>
    <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/preferences_character_echo.png"/>
    <p>
      Enabling this option causes Orca to echo the character
      you just typed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While echo by character seems quite similar to the key echo of
      alphanumeric and punctuation keys, there are important differences,
      especially with respect to accented letters and other symbols for which
      there is no dedicated key:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>
          Key echo causes <app>Orca</app> to announce what you just <em>
          pressed</em>.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          Character echo causes <app>Orca</app> to announce what was just
          <em>inserted</em>.
        </p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>
      Thus to have accented characters spoken as you type them, you should
      enable character echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: not checked
    </p>
    <note style="tip">
      <title>Enabling both key echo and character echo</title>
      <p>
        If you like key echo and you frequently type accented characters,
        consider enabling both. <app>Orca</app>'s character echo logic
        attempts to filter out characters which were spoken as a result
        of key echo, thus minimizing the likelihood of "double speaking"
        as you type.

      Checking the <gui>Enable echo by word</gui> checkbox causes
      <app>Orca</app> to echo the word you just typed. Similarly,
      checking the <gui>Enable echo by sentence</gui> checkbox causes
      <app>Orca</app> to echo the sentence you just typed.
