  <title>Structural Navigation</title>
  <p>
    <app>Orca</app>'s Structural Navigation feature allows you to navigate
    amongst elements in a document. The types of elements by which you can
    navigate include:
  </p>
  <list>
    <item><p>Headings and other text blocks</p></item>
    <item><p>Form controls</p></item>
    <item><p>Links</p></item>
    <item><p>Lists and list items</p></item>
    <item><p>Landmarks, separators, and anchors</p></item>
    <item><p>Tables and table cells</p></item>
  </list>
  <p>
    A full list of individual elements and their associated keybindings can
    be found in <link xref="commands_structural_navigation">Structural
    Navigation Commands</link>.

      <title>Supported Applications</title>
      <p>
        Currently, Structural Navigation is fully implemented for web content,
        including the help content you are reading now. <app>Orca</app>'s
        Structural Navigation support for table cells has also been implemented
        for <app>OpenOffice Writer</app> and <app>LibreOffice Writer</app>.
        Implementing the remainder of the Structural Navigation objects to
        these office suites requires changes to be made by their respective
        developers. Implementing any Structural Navigation features within
        <app>Evince</app> will require a similar effort on the part of its
        developers.
      </p>
      <note style="tip">
        <title>Don't Forget To Toggle Structural Navigation On!</title>
        <p>
          Depending on where you are, it may be necessary for you to explicitly
          toggle Structural Navigation on before you can use it.
        </p>
      </note>
      <section id="toggling_required">
        <title>When Toggling Structural Navigation On Is Required</title>
        <p>
          In web pages, explicitly toggling Structural Navigation on is
          generally unnecessary because your interaction with the document
          largely consists of reading its content. Thus there is no question
          as to whether the 'H' you just pressed was meant to be a writing
          command or a navigation command.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, in editable documents such as those found in
          <app>OpenOffice</app> and <app>LibreOffice</app>, it is far more
          difficult for <app>Orca</app> to accurately predict what you expect
          to have happen as a result of pressing 'H'. Therefore, before you
          can use any Structural Navigation command in an editable document,
          you must first toggle Structural Navigation on by pressing
          <keyseq><key>Orca Modifier</key><key>Z</key></keyseq>.
          When you are finished navigating and ready to resume writing, press
          <keyseq><key>Orca Modifier</key><key>Z</key></keyseq> again to toggle
          Structural Navigation off.

      In addition to the aforementioned commands, <app>Orca</app> has a number
      of configurable options available specifically for applications in which
      there is structural navigation support.

      <title>Configuring Structural Navigation</title>
      <item>
        <p>
          Give focus to an application for which <app>Orca</app> has
          Structural Navigation support.

      <item>
        <p>
          Get into the <link xref="preferences">Orca Preferences</link>
          dialog box for the current application by pressing:
          <keyseq>
            <key>Ctrl</key><key>Orca Modifier</key><key>Space</key>
          </keyseq>
        </p>

      <item>
        <p>
          Navigate to the last page of the dialog box which should be
          named according to the name of your current application.
