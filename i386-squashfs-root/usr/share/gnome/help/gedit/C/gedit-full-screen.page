  <title>Use fullscreen mode</title>

  <p>When working with a large document, you may find it helpful to work in <app>gedit's</app> fullscreen mode. Using fullscreen mode will hide the <gui>menu bar</gui>, <gui>tab bar</gui> and the <gui>tool bar</gui>, presenting you with more of your text and allowing you to better focus on your tasks.</p>

  <section id="turn-on-full-screen">
    <title>Turn on fullscreen mode</title>
    <p>To turn on fullscreen mode, select <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Fullscreen</gui></guiseq>, or press <key>F11</key>. <app>gedit's</app> menu, title, and tab-bars will hide, and you will only be presented with the text of your current file.</p>
    <p>If you need to perform an action from the <app>gedit</app> menu while working in fullscreen mode, move your mouse pointer to the top of the screen. The <app>gedit</app> menu bar will reappear, and you can select your desired action.</p>

 <note><p>To switch between open tabs while in fullscreen mode, press either <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Alt</key><key>PgUp</key></keyseq> or <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Alt</key><key>PgDn</key></keyseq>.</p></note>
