  <title>IRC account details</title>

  <p>IRC accounts require different information than many other types of
  accounts.  To create an IRC account, you must specify at least an IRC
  network and a nickname.  This page details the information you can
  provide for an IRC account.</p>

  <note style="info package">
    <p>You must have the <sys>telepathy-idle</sys> package installed to use IRC 
    in <app>Empathy</app>.</p>

      <title><gui>Network</gui></title>
      <p>IRC is an open system that allows people to run separate IRC
      networks.  Each network is distinct and has its own users and
      chat rooms.  <app>Empathy</app> lists the most popular networks
      in the <gui>Network</gui> drop-down list.  You can add additional
      networks.  See <link xref="#networks"/> below.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Nickname</gui></title>
      <p>Your nickname is your unique name on the IRC network. Only one
      person on a network may use a given nickname.  If you get an error
      message that says <link xref="prob-conn-name" role="error-msg"/>
      you will need to change your nickname.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Password</gui></title>
      <p>Some servers, particularly those on private networks, require
      a password to connect.  If you are authorized to use the network,
      the network administrators should provide you with a password.</p>
      <note>
        <title>NickServ Passwords</title>
        <p>On some networks, nicknames can be registered using a service
        known as NickServ.  <app>Empathy</app> does not directly support
        nickname passwords.  On some networks, including the popular
        freenode network, server passwords are automatically forwarded
        to NickServ, allowing you to set this field to identify yourself
        with NickServ.  See <link xref="irc-nick-password"/> for more
        details.</p>
      </note>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Real name</gui></title>
      <p>You can provide your real name in addition to your nickname.  Other
      users will be able to see this when they view your information.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Quit message</gui></title>
      <p>When you go offline, a quit message is sent to all the chat rooms
      you’re in and to all the users you’re having a private conversation
      with.  Use this field to provide a custom quit message.</p>

    <title>Networks</title>

    <p><app>Empathy</app> includes a list of popular IRC networks.  If you
    wish to another IRC network, you can add it to the list.  You can also
    modify networks and remove them from the list.</p>

    <list>
      <item><p>To add a network to the list, click <media type="image"
      mime="image/png" src="figures/gtk-add.png" width="16"
      height="16">Add</media>.</p></item>
      <item><p>To modify a network in the list, select the network and click
      <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/gtk-edit.png" width="16"
             height="16">Edit</media>.</p></item>
      <item><p>To remove a network from the list, select the network and
      click <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/gtk-remove.png"
      width="16" height="16">Remove</media>.</p></item>
    </list>

    <p>When adding or modifying a network, you can enter the following
    information:</p>

    <terms>
      <item>
        <title><gui>Network</gui></title>
        <p>This is the name of the network as you want it to appear in
        the list of networks.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <title><gui>Charset</gui></title>
        <p>This specifies the character encoding that is typically used on
        this network.  A character encoding is a specific way of recording
        characters internally in a computer.  There are many character
        encodings, and you need to use the same character encoding as other
        users to see their messages correctly.</p>
        <!--
            Translators: Recommend character encodings that are common
            for your language.
        -->
        <p>By default, <app>Empathy</app> uses UTF-8, a modern character
        encoding that can handle text from most of the world's languages.
        Another common encoding for English and some other Western languages
        is ISO-8859-1.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <title><gui>Servers</gui></title>
        <p>An IRC network may have many servers you can connect to.  When
        you are connected to a server on a particular network, you can
        communicate with all users on all other servers on that network.
        You can add and remove servers for this network using the
        <gui>Add</gui> and <gui>Remove</gui> buttons.</p>
        <p>When a server is selected, click the field under <gui>Server</gui>
        or <gui>Port</gui> to edit it.  Alternatively, use the left and right
        arrow keys to focus the field, and press the space bar to begin
        editing.</p>
        <p>Select the check box in the <gui>SSL</gui> column to encrypt
        all communication with a server.  Note that this does not prevent
        other users on the network from seeing what you write on public
        chat rooms.</p>
