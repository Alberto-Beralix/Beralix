  <title>Register for a new account</title>

  <p>Most account types require you to create an account with a account provider
  before you can connect using instant messaging applications like <app>Empathy</app>.
  With some account providers, you can use <app>Empathy</app> to register for a new
  account, using the same steps as you would to <link xref="add-account">add an
  account</link>.</p>

  <p>This page provides information on creating a new account for various types of
  accounts.  Your account provider should give you a login ID and a password, as well
  as any additional information you need to connect using <app>Empathy</app>.</p>

    <title>Facebook</title>

    <title>Jabber</title>

    <p>Jabber is an open instant messaging system.  Like email, Jabber allows
    you to choose your account provider and communicate with all other Jabber
    users, regardless of their account provider.</p>

    <p>You will need to create a new account with a Jabber provider.  There are
    many free providers; one popular provider is
    <link href="http://register.jabber.org/">Jabber.org</link>.</p>

    <note>
      <p>If you use Google Mail or Google Talk, you already have a Jabber account.
      Google Talk is a Jabber service.  Simply use your Google Mail address and
      password in <app>Empathy</app> to connect.</p>

    <title>People Nearby</title>

    <p>You do not need to create an account with a service provider to use this
    feature.  This service works whenever you are connected to a local network,
    such as a wireless hotspot.  It automatically finds all other users on the
    network who are also using this service.</p>

    <p>For more information, see <link xref="salut-protocol" />.</p>

    <title>SIP</title>

    <p>SIP is an open system which allows users to have audio and video
    conversations over the Internet.  You need to create an account with
    a SIP provider.  You can communicate with all other SIP users,
    regardless of which SIP provider they use.</p>

    <note style="warning">
      <p>Due to technical differences, the free <link
      href="https://www.ekiga.net/index.php?page=register">Ekiga.net</link>
      service does not currently work with <app>Empathy</app>.</p>
    </note>

    <p>Some SIP providers allow you to call normal phones from your computer.
    Generally, you will need to subscribe to a paid service for this feature.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="irc">
    <title>IRC</title>

    <p>You do not need to register for an account to use IRC.  Although you specify
    a nickname when you add an IRC account to <app>Empathy</app>, this nickname is
    only established each time you connect.  If another user is using the nickname,
    you will need to choose a new nickname.</p>

    <p>Some IRC networks use a service called NickServ to allow users to protect
    their nicknames.  See <link xref="irc-nick-password"/> for more information.</p>

    <p>Some IRC servers are password protected.  You will need to know the password
    to connect to these servers.  Generally, these are private IRC networks.</p>

  <section id="proprietary-services">
    <title>Proprietary Services</title>

    <p>There are many proprietary instant messaging services that have been
    developed by different companies or organizations.  <app>Empathy</app>
    allows you to connect to an existing account for most popular services.
    To create a new account with one of these services, you will need to
    visit the serviceâ€™s web site and agree to its terms of use.</p>
