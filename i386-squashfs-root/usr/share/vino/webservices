# This file lists all webservices URLs that can be used by vino to provide
# a connectivity test.

# The webservice must be a XMLRPC service, which provides a method 'vino.check':
# vino.check (
#   IN int port, -> port to be tested against. Default is 5900.
#   IN int timeout, -> timeout, in seconds to cancel the testing. Default is 10.
#   OUT string IP, -> The public IP of the machine (variable 'REMOTE_ADDR').
#   OUT bool status, -> True if can connect to the host at specified port.
#   OUT string version -> Version of the method signature, currently is "0.1".
# )
# 
# Basically what the service does is: Try to open a connection into the
# incoming host (REMOTE_ADDR) at the specified port. It returns the IP and
# if the connection was established successfully.

# Check a PHP implementation of that service in the file org.gnome.vino.Service.php,
# shipped in vino source code, in 'capplet' folder.

# Put one address per line. Blank lines and started with a '#' are ignored.
