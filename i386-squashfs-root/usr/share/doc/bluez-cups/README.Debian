bluez-cups

To configure a Bluetooth printer, set it up in CUPS like it was connected to
your parallel or USB port. Then edit your /etc/cups/printers.conf and replace
the device URI with a bluetooth one.

The printer's URI will look something like this: bluetooth://00408C5E5DA4/spp
If your printer uses HCRP (hardcopy cable replacement protocol) then remove
the "/spp" from the end.  SPP is serial port protocol.
