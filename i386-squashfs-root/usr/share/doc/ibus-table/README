== Introduction ==
IBus-Table is the IM Engine framework for table-based input methods, such as
ZhengMa, WuBi, ErBi, CangJie and so on.
The aim of IBus-Table is to make the users of table-based input methods
can enjoy the typing on Linux environment.
Definitly, it is far from perfect, so if you have any wish or any
suggestion, please file a issue on http://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues
or send me an email <acevery@gmail.com>, I would be very please to hear
from you :)
