This directory contains some scripts used to post-process popularity-contest
entries.  You should have a lot of submissions from different users (at
least 100 of them, if possible) for these results to be valid.

To collect results, use procmail or some other mail alias to e-mail
submissions to a file called, say, new-popcon-entries.

You should run popcon-process.sh once a day, or so.  It calls prepop.pl to
split the mailbox file into a directory (popcon-entries) with one file per
submission, and only one submission per participant.  (Since each
participant makes a submission only once per day, it's very important to
remove duplicates.)

HINT: if you have an account on popcon.debian.org, you can find a pre-processed
popcon-entries directory in /org/popcon.debian.org/popcon-mail.  Feel free to
use these files to generate your own statistics.

Now you can do, for example:

	cat popcon-entries/*/* | popanal.py
	
which creates a file named results.  Output lines look like this:

   <name> <vote> <old> <recent-ctime> <no-files>
   
<name> is the package name;
<vote> is the number of people who use this package regularly;
<old> is the number of people who installed, but don't use this package
	regularly;
<recent-ctime> is the number of people who upgraded this package recently;
<no-files> is the number of people whose entry didn't contain enough
	information (atime and ctime were 0).
