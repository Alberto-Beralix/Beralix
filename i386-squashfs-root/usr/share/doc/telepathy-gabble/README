telepathy-gabble
================

Gabble is a Jabber/XMPP connection manager for the Telepathy framework,
currently supporting:

* single-user chats
* multi-user chats
* voice/video calling
* file transfer

with Jabber/XMPP and Google Talk interoperability.

Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
applications.

Requirements
============

telepathy-gabble requires:
  telepathy-glib <http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/telepathy-glib/>
  GLib, GObject <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glib/>
  libdbus <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/>
  The D-Bus GLib bindings <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/>
  libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>
  libnice <http://nice.freedesktop.org/releases/>
  libsoup <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libsoup/>

and either:
  GNUTLS <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/>
or
  OpenSSL <http://www.openssl.org/>

At build time, it also requires:
  GNU make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
  pkg-config <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pkg-config/>
  libxslt, xsltproc <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
  Python <http://www.python.org/>

See configure.ac for full details, including versions required.

Building from git also requires the GNU build system (Autoconf, Automake,
libtool).

Versioning policy
=================

We use an "odd/even" versioning scheme where the minor version (the y in
x.y.z) determines stability - stable branches have y even, development
branches have y odd.

Unreleased builds straight from git identify themselves as version
"x.y.z.1". These are compiled with -Werror, so they might stop working
if your gcc version issues more warnings than ours. If this is a problem
for you, use a release tarball.
