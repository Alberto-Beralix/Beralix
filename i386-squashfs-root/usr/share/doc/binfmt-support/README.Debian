binfmt-support for Debian
-------------------------

You must have binfmt_misc either compiled into your Linux kernel or
available as a module in order to use this package. The module will be
automatically inserted if necessary.

If you're a system administrator, update-binfmts(8) should tell you all you
need to know about how to use update-binfmts to manage your own local binary
formats.

If you're a package maintainer and want to use update-binfmts, you should
install a format file like the following (without the leading spaces) in
/usr/share/binfmts:

  package javawrapper
  interpreter /usr/bin/javawrapper
  magic \xca\xfe\xba\xbe

Assuming that this file is installed in /usr/share/binfmts/javawrapper, the
postinst should then do this:

  if [ "$1" = configure ] && which update-binfmts >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    update-binfmts --import javawrapper
  fi

The prerm script should then do the reverse:

  if [ "$1" = remove ] && which update-binfmts >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    update-binfmts --package javawrapper \
      --remove javawrapper /usr/bin/javawrapper
  fi

You should add 'Conflicts: binfmt-support (<< 1.1.2)' to your control file
to ensure that the --import option is available and working.

binfmt-support currently has no effect on the Hurd, although it should
install without any problems. Patches from Hurd experts to make translators
look like this interface are welcome.
