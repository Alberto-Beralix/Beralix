<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Configuring the Printing Clients.</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Setting up Printing from a Windows Client. </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Open the <B>Settings/Printers</B> folder, and start the
<B>Add Printer</B> Wizard.  Choose to add a Network Printer,
and browse the network to find the Printer Shares you configured on
the host (e.g., HP722C-PPA and HP722C-PS).  If they are not visible,
either the Host or the network is not properly configured.  Correct
the problem before proceding.  
<P>Normally, you will probably want to use
the  native Windows HP PPA  drivers, so select the printer Share that accepts
PPA input (e.g., HP722C-PPA).  If the Host
is a Windows Host, it will provide the drivers over the network, 
otherwise you will have to
find the printer in the list of available HP  Printer drivers,
or click on <B>Have Disk</B> and install them from HP's installation CD.
You then get a chance to change the name with which the printer will be
known on the Client.  Finally, you should choose to print a test page.
<P>You might instead (or also) want to set up printing
services using the Printer Share that accepts Postscript
(e.g., HP722C-PS).
In that case, if the Host is not a Windows Host, choose a
&quot;generic&quot; PostScript printer like the
Apple LaserWriter II NT or the Digital turboPrintServer 20/Net.
<P>If the test page prints sucessfully, you are finished!
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Setting up Printing from a Linux/Unix Samba Client </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>First examine the network by opening a terminal window and
using the command 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
smbclient -L hostname
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(where &quot;hostname&quot; should be replaced by the
network name of the Host to which the printer is attached).
This will list
the SMB services provided by that Host.
(Alternatively, your
system may have some graphical front-end to <CODE>smbclient</CODE>
that allows you to inspect the network.)
The list should include
the Printer Share(s) you configured on the Host
(e.g., HP722C-PPA and HP722C-PS).  If these are 
absent, you must first identify and correct the problem.
<P>You must now configure the printer.   The details of how to do this
will vary between Linux/Unix distributions, but there will probably
be support for network printing using Samba.     
<P>If the Printer Share
you wish to use is intended to accept PPA input
(e.g., HP722C-PPA), configure the Client to use the <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
driver.
<P>If it is intended to accept PostScript input
(e.g., HP722C-PS), configure the Client to print to a PostScript printer.
<P>You may wish to configure both types of printers, and experiment
to see which provides the best printing services on your network.
<P>See the SMB-HOWTO documentation for more information.
