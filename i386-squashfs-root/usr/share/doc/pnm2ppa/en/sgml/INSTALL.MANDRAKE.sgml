<bf> Mandrake-specific issues.</bf>

See the document
<htmlurl 
url="file:INSTALL.REDHAT.html"
name="INSTALL.REDHAT.html">
for installation and setup.  That document is written
for Red Hat; note the Mandrake-specific differences 
listed below,

<bf> To update <tt>pnm2ppa</tt>
in any recent Mandrake release (7.2 or later) from  v1.04 to v1.10, 
the simplest procedure may  be
just to compile pnm2ppa from tarball source and replace the Mandake binaries
<tt>/usr/bin/pnm2ppa</tt> and <tt>/usr/bin/calibrate_ppa</tt> with
the new versions.   They should function as drop-in replacements,
with the same user interface, but improved image quality.
(You may also wish to use the newer <tt>pnm2ppa.conf</tt> configuration
file template).</bf>





<itemize>
<item> Mandrake 7.0 and earlier has incompatible and non-functional
<tt>pnm2ppa</tt> support which must be  replaced.
Please use 
<tt>printtool</tt> to delete any installed PPA printers   BEFORE
upgrading <tt>rhs-printfilters</tt>.  (If you forget to do this, and
printtool will not start after the update, delete or move your
<tt>/etc/printcap</tt> file.)
Install the <tt>pnm2ppa</tt> RPM package.
Then update <tt>rhs-printfilters</tt> with
<tt>rhs-printfilters-1.58-4ppa5mdk.i386.rpm</tt>
from
<htmlurl 
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa"
name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">.
(Do  <bf>NOT</bf> use <tt>rhs-printfilters-1.57-4ppa4.i386.rpm</tt>
which is for RedHat systems only.)
<item>
Mandrake-7.1 supplies a <tt>pnm2ppa</tt> RPM  and has support for
it in <tt>rhs-printfilters</tt>.   Mandrake 7.1 has a configuration
tool <tt>DrakConf</tt> for setting up printers, which may
be an interface to <tt>printtool</tt>.
Some users have reported difficulties with this.  In that case, just use 
<tt>printtool</tt> to configure the printer.
<item>
Mandrake-7.2  does not have a separate <tt>pnm2ppa</tt> RPM package, but has
added  <tt>pnm2ppa</tt> to the <tt>ghostscript</tt> RPM package.  This creates
difficulties for updating <tt>pnm2ppa</tt> with the RPM package from
<htmlurl 
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa"
name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">.
You will get reported conflicts with <tt>ghostscript</tt> 
if you try to install the
<tt>pnm2ppa-1.04-1.i386.rpm</tt> package, 
but it seems that you can 
safely  use the rpm  option <tt>--force</tt> to force its installation.
Mandrake-7.2 also has moved to using CUPS as its printing system,
and appears to now have its own printer configuration tool, but still
includes <tt>pnm2ppa</tt> support in <tt>rhs-printfilters</tt>.
