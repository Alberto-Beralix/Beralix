TODO
UPDATE (June 10, 2002) 
*  Striping in images like ghostscript' example image "tiger.ps'
   has been eliminated by just making sure that black ink is never overprinted
   by color ink.   A major reworking  to cutswath.c and some improvements to
   image.c were needed.  This is probably the final work done on this driver..

--------------------------------
Code issues (comments by duncan):
* implement data compression for color as well as
  black and white printing.
* check out the new information about the buffer on the printer.
  (mentioned on ppa.devel by andrew in early 2000)
* cleaning head codes needed. (or put them into PUP);
  document the codes in  the ppa docs here.
* should multiple color sweeps in a swath (gMaxpass=4)
  alternate between right-to-left and left-to-right ?

* The Windows driver  also has a "normal" mode with gMaxPass=2, and well
  as "econofast" (gMaxPass=1) and high quality (gMaxPass=4).  It
  alternates color passes in one direction with black passes in the
  other direction, at the same vertical position.
  If this structure is adopted, maybe the way the 600dpi resolution of black
  if reduced to 300dpi resolution in dither.c should be rethought.
  (Why not keep 600dpi black resolution ?).

* A FS_black_dither routine is needed in black-only printing, for high-quality
  black-only images.


* add autodetection of device via IEEE 1284 and other methods
* redo debugging support	(done ajv)
* add extra .conf parameters to avoid recompiles (done: ajv & giorgio)
* getopt() rather than current handling	(done:	ajv 19991003)

Distribution and Installation issues

* *BSD compatibility (partially there: ajv 19991021)
* update README and all doco
* update installation instructions for major distributions (caldera, RH, etc)
* Translate man page into other languages
* add autoconf support ? (NetBSD and alpha issues)
* update CREDITS
* Make install target	(done: ajv)
* make syslog configurable; stdout or syslog (done: ajv 19991021)

CALIBRATION
* CALIBRATE doco, and supporting .ps file to generate page

Long Term wants

* write instructions on how to speed up parallel port (Linux 2.2.x and later)
* write hppaconf (KDE)?
* gs native filter rather than take pnm/pbm/ppm files
* scpd to monitor printer status, and provide support for console alerts
  (These are dumb printers, so ...)
