This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Crypt::PasswdMD5
(renamed to be libcrypt-passwdmd5-perl), a Perl module for
interoperable MD5-based crypt().

Bart Bunting <bart@debian.org> assembled this package.  The
library is available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(CPAN). Visit <URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN site near
you.
This package was maintained by Florian Ernst <florian@debian.org>.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files.
