Crypt::PasswdMD5
================

This  code  provides  various  crypt()-compatible  interfaces  to  the
MD5-based crypt() function found in  various *nixes. It's based on the
implementation  found  on FreeBSD  2.2.[56]-RELEASE  and contains  the
following license in it:

"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
<phk@login.dknet.dk>  wrote this  file.  As  long as  you  retain this
notice you can  do whatever you want with this stuff.  If we meet some
day, and you  think this stuff is worth  it, you can buy me  a beer in
return.  Poul-Henning Kamp

To install, follow the standard CPAN recipe of:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test

If all tests pass, then do

$ make install

You can see the documentation by issuing the following command at a
nearby shell

$ perldoc Crypt::PasswdMD5

Bug  reports  are  welcome. Please  do  not  forget  to tell  me  what
version/platform are you running this code on. Providing a small piece
of  code that  shows the  bug helps  me a  lot in  sorting it  out and
possibly in writting more tests for the distribution.

Report your bugs to me (luismunoz@cpan.org).
