This is the ubuntu version of aptdaemon.

We carry the following patch that may not get upstream:
03_auth_me_less.patch:
 Its for the use case when adding a repository, doing a reload
 and immediately installing a package from it. Upstream is fine
 with the patch as a distro patch but it may not make it upstream
