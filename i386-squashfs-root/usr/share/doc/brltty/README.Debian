brltty for Debian
-----------------

The ViaVoice and Theta speech modules are intentionally not included in the
binary package due to license incompatibilities.

I also removed /sbin/brltty-install because I think
as soon as we have a .deb package, the reinstall
method isn't necessary.
(feel free to complain about this if you need it).
