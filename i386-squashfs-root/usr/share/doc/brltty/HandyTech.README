This directory contains the BRLTTY driver for braille displays which are
manufactured by Handy Tech Elektronik GmbH [http://www.handytech.com/] of
Germany. As a component of BRLTTY, this driver is released under the terms of
the GNU Public License. It has been tested with the modular displays
[20/40/80], the Braille Wave, the Braille Star [40/80], the Bookworm, and
the Braillino.

This driver was originally implemented by Andreas Gross <andi@andi-bika.de>. It
has since been extended, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke
<dave@mielke.cc>. Thanks to Mike Pedersen <mpedersen@mindspring.com> for his
help with the design and testing of the Braille Star component. Thanks to Jill
Clark <jill@handytech.com> of Handy Tech Elektronik for having graciously lent
us a Bookworm so that its component could be tested. Thanks to Mario Lang 
<mlang@delysid.org> for his help with the development of USB and bluetooth 
support.

A HandyTech display can be used via its serial, USB, or bluetooth interface. If
you're using a serial connection then specify "serial:/path/to/device", e.g. 
"serial:/dev/ttyS0". If you're using a USB connection then specify "usb:" (the
trailing colon is important). If you're using a bluetooth connection then
specify "bluez:address", e.g. "bluez:01:23:45:67:89:AB".

Braille Star models allow the use of an external keyboard for input. It can be
used not only while the Braille Star is in "Notetaker" mode, i.e. while not
connected to any external PC hardware, but also as a keyboard for the PC
itself. Either connect the second PS/2 cable from your display to your PC
(that's the old way), or just disable "Ext. keyboard autoselect" in the
internal menu. This latter, much simpler, approach causes the keyboard's
signals to be sent over whatever interface (serial, USB, or bluetooth) you're
using to connect your display to your PC. It's particularly advantageous to use
the external keyboard in conjunction with a bluetooth connection since this
combination effectively transforms the Braille Star into a completely wireless
yet fully functional braille terminal.
