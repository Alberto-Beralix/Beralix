SUPPORTED HARDWARE
==================

This driver was developped to make the new Iris protocol being used into 
BRLTTY. This is a really specific stuff for now, it is designed to 
allow someone to put a Lioux distribution into his/her Iris. 

WARNING!!!!!! :
	You're __NOT ENCOURAGED__ to put a Linux distribution into your Iris
for several reasons :
	* Neither me, nor EuroBRAILLE sa, are responsible for all things that 
	  could happen to your flash card, usb key, or any other device;
	* There is no user interface for now, do not expect to find the same
	  interface as you find into the official Iris software.
	* And to conclude, this is ALPHA STAGE, so it may contain bugs,
	  can crash your system...


FIXES/ADDITIONS
===============
Version 0.3:
	- Rewritten IO stuff, to be compatible with the HAVE_KEYCODES stuff;
	  This was done to make the "pcb" application usable.
	- Partially debug some keypress bugs, not perfect yet. 
	  Please Do NOT USE the Level keys (Level 1 to 4).

Version 0.2:
	- Combined keys works for linear keyboards.
	- LCD Display support (for IRIS 20/40).

Version 0.1:
	- Initial release;
	- Braille keyboard and cursor routing works, commands are only 
	  ''one key at a time''.

Comments are strongly welcomed, because I don't know how many people use the 
EuroBraille version of BRLTTY in the world so if you use this driver, just 
e-mail me what are your suggestions for next versions.
