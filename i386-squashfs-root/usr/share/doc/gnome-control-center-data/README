GNOME Control Center  
====================

About -

The control center is GNOME's main interface for configuration of various
aspects of your desktop.

Installation -

See the file 'INSTALL'

How to report bugs -

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system under the product
control-center. It is available at http://bugzilla.gnome.org. 

In the report please include the following information -

	Operating system and version
	For Linux, version of the C library
	How to reproduce the bug if possible
	If the bug was a crash, include the exact text that was printed out
	A stacktrace where possible [see below]

How to get a stack trace -

If the crash is reproducible, it is possible to get a stack trace and 
attach it to the bug report. The following steps are used to obtain a 
stack trace -
	
	Run the program in gdb [the GNU debugger] or any other debugger
		ie. gdb gnome-keyboard-properties
	Start the program
		ie. (gdb) run
	Reproduce the crash and the program will exit to the gdb prompt
	Get the back trace
		ie. (gdb) bt full

Once you have the backtrace, copy and paste this either into the 
'Comments' field or attach a file with it included.


Patches -

Patches should be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org or emailed to the 
gnomecc-list@gnome.org list. If using bugzilla, attach
the patch to a new bug report [or preferably, check to see if there is
already a bug report that corresponds to your patch]. Bug reports 
containing patches should include the 'PATCH' keyword.

Patches should be created using the unified diff form.
	ie. svn diff file-to-be-patched.c > patch.diff
