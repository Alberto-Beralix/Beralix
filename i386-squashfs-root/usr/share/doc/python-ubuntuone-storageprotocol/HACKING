Ubuntu One requires acceptance of the Canonical Contributor Agreement. You
will need to follow the instructions at:

http://www.canonical.com/contributors

Once the agreement is accepted, you will be added to the Ubuntu One Contributor
Agreement team on Launchpad, so that your branches may be merged in upstream.


In order to run tests in ubuntuone-storage-protocol, you will first need
to build the portion of code which uses Google Protocol Buffers.

$: ./setup.py build

Then you will need to run the tests. This will run lint and style checkers,
and the unit tests for the package.

$: ./run-tests


Ubuntu One uses branch based development on Launchpad, and bugs to track
features and issues. Make sure a bug is filed for the piece of code you wish
to work on. When committing your changes, be sure to specify the bug # it
fixes using the --fixes option in bzr.

$: bzr commit --fixes=lp:<BUGNUMBER>

If you forget to do this, you can link the branch manually on the Launchpad
web page. After pushing your branch to Launchpad, you will need to propose it
for merging into the parent branch. You can do this from the Launchpad web
page for your branch. In order for your branch to be accepted, you will have
to have accepted the Canonical Contributor Agreement as stated above, and
there will need to be at least two approvals from Ubuntu One developers.
