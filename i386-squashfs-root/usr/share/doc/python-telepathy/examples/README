These examples (except generate-manager-file.py) all take as their first
parameter a file which contains account details. An account file contains a set
of key/value pairs, where the key and the value are separated by a colon and a
space.

The keys "manager" and "protocol" must be present. Other values are passed to
RequestConnection().

Example:

manager: gabble
protocol: jabber
account: foo@bar.com
password: s3kr1t
server: bar.com
port: 5223
old-ssl: true
ignore-ssl-errors: true

---

generate-manager-file.py takes one argument: the name of a connection manager
(such as "gabble"), defaulting to "haze" if the argument is not found.  It
spits out suitable contents for a .manager file for that protocol.
