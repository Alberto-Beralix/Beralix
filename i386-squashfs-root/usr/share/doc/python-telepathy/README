Requirements
------------
telepathy-python requires dbus-python version >= 0.71; version >= 0.80 is
recommended.

Using an uninstalled version
----------------------------
Because telepathy-python contains generated code, the src directory
is incomplete. To run this version of telepathy-python without installing it,
you'll have to run ``python setup.py build`` and arrange for build/lib to be
on your ``sys.path``, for instance:

    python setup.py build
    PYTHONPATH=$PWD/build/lib python examples/call.py a.account b@example.com

(See ``examples/README`` for details of the .account files used by the
examples.)

Server Base Classes
-------------------
telepathy.server implements base classes and mixins for implementing all of
the D-Bus interfaces in Telepathy. Many methods are abstract and they are
intended to be overridden in mixins for the concrete implementations, but some
perform housekeeping for you and maintain structures with some of the state
necessary to answer Get* calls. The API for implementing managers needs some
fixing really.

Client Library
--------------
The client lib in telepathy.client has some base classes to help with
implementing a client in python.
