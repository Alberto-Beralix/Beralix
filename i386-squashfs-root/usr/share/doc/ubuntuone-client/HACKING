Ubuntu One requires acceptance of the Canonical Contributor Agreement. You
will need to follow the instructions at:

http://www.canonical.com/contributors

Once the agreement is accepted, you will be added to the Canonical Contributor
Agreement team on Launchpad, so that your branches may be merged in upstream.


In order to run tests in ubuntuone-client, you will need to have a built
version of ubuntuone-storage-protocol in a tree, or installed. You can
specify the path to a built tree with the --with-protocol option to configure,
or autogen.sh (which calls configure after creating it).

$: ./configure --with-protocol=$HOME/source/ubuntuone-storage-protocol/trunk

After configuring, in order to run the tests, all you need to do is run
make check.

$: make check


Ubuntu One uses branch based development on Launchpad, and bugs to track
features and issues. Make sure a bug is filed for the piece of code you wish
to work on. When committing your changes, be sure to specify the bug # it
fixes using the --fixes option in bzr.

$: bzr commit --fixes=lp:<BUGNUMBER>

If you forget to do this, you can can create an empty commit with just
the bug link in the metadata.

$: bzr commit --unchanged --fixes=lp:<BUGNUMER>

After pushing your branch to Launchpad, you will need to propose it
for merging into the parent branch. You can do this from the Launchpad web
page for your branch. In order for your branch to be accepted, you will have
to have accepted the Canonical Contributor Agreement as stated above, and
there will need to be at least two approvals from Ubuntu One developers.
