Release notes for 3.2
=====================

* The accessible implementations for GTK+ widgets have been integrated
  into libgtk itself, and the gail module does not exist anymore. This
  change should not affect applications very much.

Release notes for 3.0
=====================

* GTK+ 3 is a major new version of GTK+, which is parallel installable
  with GTK+ 2.x. For information about porting applications from GTK+ 2.x
  to GTK+ 3, see the file:

  docs/reference/gtk/html/migrating.html

  Or online at:

  http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/3.0/migrating.html

* Note that the library sonames in this release have been changed from
  libgtk-3.0 and libgdk-3.0 to libgtk-3 and libgdk-3, to prevent the
  library versions from going backwards, compared to the 2.90/91/99
  releases. Applications will have to be recompiled.
