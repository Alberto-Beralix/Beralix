gnome-keyring is a program that keep password and other secrets for
users. It is run as a damon in the session, similar to ssh-agent, and
other applications locate it via an environment variable or a dbus.

The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
disk, but forgotten when the session ends.

The library libgnome-keyring is used by applications to integrate with
the gnome keyring system.
