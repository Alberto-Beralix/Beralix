Things to do for the gtk 2.0 based release

- fix up threading to work with GObject/GSignal/GClosure.  See the
  THREADS file for more info on what is required.

- Implement a new PyGtkTreeModel GObject type that can be the base for
  new tree models defined in Python.  Need to look at how the
  GtkTreeIter->tree_node lifetime is handled, as it doesn't look like
  anything is called to let us know that that data should be unrefed.
