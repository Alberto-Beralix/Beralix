This is just another re-incarnation of many other similar projects:

 + libvncserver by Johannes E. Schindelin
     which in turn is based on:
       - OSXvnc by Dan McGuirk
       - The original Xvnc by AT&T Laboratories, Cambridge
       - TightVNC by Const Kaplinsky
       - RealVNC by James "Wez" Weatherall
     
 + krfb, KDE's desktop sharing server, by Tim Jansen
 + x11vnc.c (from libvncserver) by Karl J. Runge
 + x0rfbserver, the original native X vnc server, by Jens Wagner

Much code and ideas from each of those projects is re-used here.
