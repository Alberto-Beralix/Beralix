mhash TODO
===============================================================================

- add PANAMA hash algorithm.
- add 64 bit version of Tiger.
- add all unbroken hash algorithms from Paulo Barreto's "Hashing
   Function Lounge". In April 2004 these were: Cellhash, Parallel
   FFT-Hash, Subhash.

- add a generic support for hash functions built upon block ciphers
   (Matyas-Meyer-Oseas, Miyaguchi-Preneel, Davies-Meyer, Abreast
   Davies-Meyer, Tandem Davies-Mayer, etc). 

- It is possible to build block ciphers from hash functions (search
  the web for "Luby Rackoff" or MDC). Shouldn't mhash contain appropriate
  routines?

- If there are any MAC functions in the world, that are not built upon
   existing block ciphers or hash functions, they might be added to
   mhash. What about MAA?
