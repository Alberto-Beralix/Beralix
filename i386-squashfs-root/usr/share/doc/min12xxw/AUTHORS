The implementation for getopt_long and getline used to be part of the
GNU C Library and was modified by others to have this functionality
available if the system's C library does not provide it. getopt and
getopt_long were taken from the emacs sources, getline was taken from
the sources of the libwww library which came with the Amaya browser.
