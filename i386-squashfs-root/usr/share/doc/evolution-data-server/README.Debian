Evolution for Debian
====================

IMAP
----

In versions prior to 2.8, two different IMAP providers (backend modules) were installed. "IMAP" was considered more stable and "IMAP4rev1" had a few experimental features. Starting with version 2.8, IMAP4rev1 has been removed. All accounts with IMAP4rev1 set as server type for incoming email must be switched to IMAP.

Mailbox corruption
------------------

Mailbox summary corruption is an issue that is known to appear in exceptional cases as reported in http://bugs.debian.org/295270 and http://bugs.debian.org/347703. A typical symptom is the error message: "Error while Refreshing folder: Summary and folder mismatch, even after a sync." No data is lost, but one or more summary files are corrupted.

Before fixing the problem, backup your ~/.evolution folder just in case. Delete ~/.evolution/mail/local/MAILBOX.ev-summary where MAILBOX is your mailboxes. For example, the inbox summary file is Inbox.ev-summary. To rebuild the summaries, restart evolution and evolution-data-server.
