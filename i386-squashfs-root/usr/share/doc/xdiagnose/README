Bulletproof-X
-------------

This is a failsafe-mode for Xorg, that will be called when Xorg is
unable to start due to misconfiguration.

Todo
====
* Fallback to "vga" where vesa won't work.  So far I've not succeeded
  in getting vga started in anything better than 320x200, which is
  unusable, so fallback is not currently enabled.
* Apply the gdm config changes to gdm.conf
* Drop failsafeInstall and update this README


* Re-enable ctrl-alt-backspace
* Option to turn debugging on
* Option to turn KMS on or off
* Option to set color depth
* Option to set Xorg.0.log verbosity
* If AGP system, option to try different AGPMode values
* Troubleshooting of blank screen on lid close issue
* Troubleshooting tools for hibernation
  - Turn on hibernation monitoring
  - Provide a listing of hibernation attempts and results
  - Offer any kernel tweaks to make hibernation work better
  - Offer to file bug report about the issue
