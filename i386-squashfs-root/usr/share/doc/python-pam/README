PyPAM -- Python bindings for PAM
====================================

This is a set of Python bindings for the PAM libraries. This package
requires Python-1.5.2 or later. You can find an SRPM at these locations:

  ftp://ftp.pangalactic.org/pub/tummy/

You will need PAM 0.64 or later to compile and use this module.

For some simple examples of its use, look in the examples directory.

Compilation and Installation
====================================

I use RPM, so all that is needed is to unpack the SRPM and then a  "rpm -bb
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/PyPAM.spec".

If you received this as a tarball, try "rpm -ta PyPAM.tar.gz" instead.

If you really enjoy doing things the hard way, try the following:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
