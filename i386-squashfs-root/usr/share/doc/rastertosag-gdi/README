CUPS raster filter for Ricoh Aficio SP 1000S and SP 1100S. These
printers use the SAG-GDI raster format by Sagem Communication and do
not understand PCL or PostScript like most other Ricoh laser
printers. If you find any other Ricoh printer working with this driver
please tell.

The SAG-GDI protocol is described here:

Installation:

CUPS and Python are needed on your system. Linux distributions have
this usually included.

If you have CUPS 1.4.x or newer run the following commands as root:

cp rastertosag-gdi /usr/lib/cups/filter/
chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertosag-gdi
cp rastertosag-gdi.drv /usr/share/cups/drv/
chmod 644 /usr/share/cups/drv/rastertosag-gdi.drv

If you have CUPS 1.3.x or older run the following commands as root:

cp rastertosag-gdi /usr/lib/cups/filter/
chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertosag-gdi
cp ppd/*.ppd /usr/share/cups/model/
chmod 644 /usr/share/cups/model/rsp1?00s.ppd
killall -HUP cupsd

After that, set up your printer with the usual tools. Often it is
enough to simply plug in the printer on USB and turn it on. Then a
print queue with the newly installed driver will get set up
automatically. If not, or if the printer is connected via the network,
use the distribution's printer setup tool or the web interface of CUPS
(http://localhost:631/).
