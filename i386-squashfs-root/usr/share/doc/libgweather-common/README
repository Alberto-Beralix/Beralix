libgweather
===========

libgweather is a library to access weather information from online
services for numerous locations.

libgweather isn't supported in the devel platform, which means OS vendors 
won't guarantee the API/ABI long-term, but authors of open source apps
should feel free to use libgweather as users can always recompile against
a new version.  

To use libgweather in your code, you need to define the 
GWEATHER_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_UNSTABLE preprecessor symbol, e.g. by adding
-DGWEATHER_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_UNSTABLE to your CFLAGS.

Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc.

You may download updates to the package from:

   http://download.gnome.org/sources/libgweather/

To discuss libgweather, you may use the desktop-devel-list mailing list:

Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'. If you are not using a released version of
libgweather (for example, if you checked out the code from git), you
first need to run './autogen.sh'.
