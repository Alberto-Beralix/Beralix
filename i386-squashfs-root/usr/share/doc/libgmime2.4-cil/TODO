The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.


- make thread-safe? some stuff already is, like the gmime-iconv code
and some of the other charset stuff. Streams and other objects,
however, are not. How can I do this...? And is it really needed?

- Possibly make the GMime parser incremental.

- modify address parser:

<charles> on usenet it's not uncommon to have header like "From: Joe Bob"
<charles> where people use no address at all to avoid spammers
<fejj> ok
<charles> It would be nice if internet-address handled this
<charles> have ->name == "Joe Bob" and ->value.addr == NULL
<fejj> oh, so only support writing them? ah, that should be easy
<charles> It looks like the else clause on line 582 is where a "Joe Bob" string fails
<fejj> I was pondering how I could possibly parse that as a name :)
<charles> No, I am asking about parsing
<fejj> oh
<charles> It would be nice for internet_address_parse_string() to return an 
InternetAddress with a name of "Joe Bob" and a NULL addr
<fejj> ah, okay
<fejj> I guess I can do that
<fejj> I'll have to modify my internet_address_to_string code to handle that too
<fejj> but that should be easy

Ideas for GMime "3.0"
=====================

- Add internet_address_new_name_static() which would take static
  strings (e.g. strings which should not be free'd on destroy) so that
  apps can save string memory by reusing strings.

- GMimeStream's should take GError args so apps don't have to rely on
  errno (really needed for apps that implement ssl streams or other
  stream types which might not map well to libc's errno values)

- GMimeParser should also take a GError arg and/or return int error
  codes.
