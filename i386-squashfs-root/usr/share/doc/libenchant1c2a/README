libenchant -- Generic spell checking library
Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

   libenchant is licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL included in the
file COPYING.LIB.

   The project aims to provide an efficient extensible abstraction for
dealing with different spell checking libraries.

   Enchant is meant to provide a generic interface into various existing
spell checking libaries. These include, but are not limited to:
	* Aspell/Pspell
	* Ispell
	* Hspell
	* Uspell

   Enchant is also meant to be used in a cross-platform (XP) environment. Part
of this means that Enchant wants to limit its number of external dependencies
to 0, or as close is as humanly possible. Also, any enchant consumer (i.e. a
Word Processor) should not need to know about what backend providers Enchant
knows about. In fact, Enchant shouldn't even need to know this information
itself. To accomplish this, all of Enchant's providers are DLLs.

   Enchant is also meant to be used in a multi-user environment, such as Unix.
It is preferable to have both a $USER and a $GLOBAL location for both 
provider DLLs and for dictionaries themselves, when possible. Enchant's DLL
location algorithm takes this into account, and gives preference to the $USER
DLLs, when found.
