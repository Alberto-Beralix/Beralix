branding-ubuntu for Debian
--------------------------

The intended standard format for this package is to simply replace artwork in /usr/share/foo/bar with new artwork in this package, installed to /usr/share/branding/foo/bar. Programs using this artwork will need to be modified to test for /usr/share/branding/foo/bar existence and fall back to the unbranded version.
