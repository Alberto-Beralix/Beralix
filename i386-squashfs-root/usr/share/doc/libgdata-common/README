libgdata
========

libgdata is a GLib-based library for accessing online service APIs using the
GData protocol --- most notably, Google's services. It provides APIs to access
the common Google services, and has full asynchronous support.

See the test programs in gdata/tests/ for simple examples of how to use the
code.

libgdata's API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.

Dependencies
============

 * glib-2.0 >= 2.19.0
 * libxml-2.0
 * gio-2.0 >= 2.17.3
 * libsoup-2.4 >= 2.26.1
 * liboauth >= 0.94

If compiling with --enable-gnome (for GNOME support):
 * libsoup-gnome-2.4

Environment variables
=====================

If the environment variable LIGDATA_DEBUG is set to one of the following
values, libgdata will give debug output (at various levels):
 0: Output no debug messages or network logs
 1: Output debug messages, but not network logs
 2: Output debug messages and network traffic headers
 3: Output debug messages and full network traffic logs
If LIBGDATA_DEBUG is unset, no debug output will be produced.
