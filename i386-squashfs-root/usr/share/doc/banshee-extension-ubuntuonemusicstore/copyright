License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 1. Definitions
    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
       pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
       arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
       or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or
       any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
       including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
       a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
       for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
       the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
       considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
       encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
       or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
       below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
       contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
       included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
       contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
       themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
       that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
       defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
       http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
       Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
       including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
       have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
       License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
       works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
       Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
       License.
    d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
       copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
       transfer of ownership.
    e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
       selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
       Attribution, ShareAlike.
    f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
       offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
       individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
       individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition
       (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,
       and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
       otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
       (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
       entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
       (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
       broadcast.
    h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
       this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
       scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
       expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
       writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
       dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
       in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
       cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
       process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
       architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to
       which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
       three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or
       science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data
       to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
       performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
       otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
       who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
       the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
       exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
       communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
       process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
       performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
       members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
       individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
       means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
       of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
       rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
    k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
       without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
       fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
       protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
       medium.
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collections;
    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
       including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
       clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
       the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
       original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
       could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
       Collections; and,
    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt:
          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
             which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
             compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
             the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
             You of the rights granted under this License;
         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
             which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
             compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
             exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
             of the rights granted under this License; and,
        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
             royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor
             is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
             licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of
             the rights granted under this License.
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
       this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
       Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
       Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
       the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
       recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
       under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
       keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
       of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
       Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
       impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
       ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4
       (a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
       not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
       to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
       from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
       Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You
       create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
       Section 4(c), as requested.
    b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
       of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
       License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
       license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
       License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
       (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
       under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the
       terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of
       any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
       License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
       generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of,
       or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
       You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
       terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
       or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;
       (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable
       License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work
       as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)
       when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
       impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
       restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
       exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
       Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
       incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
       apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
       Applicable License.
    c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
       Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
       4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
       reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
       Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
       Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
       a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
       ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
       or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
       title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
       practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
       with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
       licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3
       (b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
       Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
       Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The
       credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
       manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
       Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
       contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
       part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
       credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt,
       You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
       under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
       any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
       Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
       of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
       the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
       otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
       Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
       or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
       derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
       the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
       jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
       Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
       deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
       action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
       Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
       fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
       reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right
       to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
       You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
       provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
       those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
       termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
       perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
       Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
       Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
       any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
       withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
       to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
       the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
       terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
       offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
       and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
       remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
       parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
       consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
       by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
       respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
       agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
       appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
       without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
       License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
       for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
       September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
       the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
       rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
       which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
       in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
       under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
       under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
       the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
       rights under applicable law.
