sane-utils (sane-backends) for Debian
-------------------------------------

This package contains various utilities shipped with sane-backends, among
which saned, the network scanner daemon used to share scanners over the
network.


saned setup

Please read this file carefully to setup your saned server properly.

 Setting up permissions for saned
 --------------------------------

A saned user and a saned group have been added to your system; it is highly
recommended to run saned as user and group saned and NEVER EVER as root.

To operate properly, saned must be able to access your scanners; different
setups are possible, depending on who should be able to use the scanners:

 * saned users only:
   => device owned by saned:saned, saned:root or root:saned

 * saned users and local users:
   => device owned by saned:scanner, local users added to the scanner group

 * local users only:
   => device owned by root:scanner, local users added to the scanner group

By default the saned user is NOT part of the scanner group. If you add the
saned user to the scanner group, ALL scanners will be made available over the
network without restrictions. Do that if you do not want/need to restrict one
or more scanners to local users only.

If you intend to use saned with a USB scanner, note that the permissions for
USB scanners are handled by udev.

See /usr/share/doc/libsane/README.Debian.gz for more information on setting up
appropriate permissions.

 Running saned from inetd
 ------------------------

To enable saned in the default configuration (running as user and group saned),
use update-inetd to enable the service:
 # update-inetd --enable sane-port
To disable saned, use update-inetd to disable the service:
 # update-inetd --disable sane-port

If you want to run saned under another user and/or group, edit /etc/inetd.conf
and change saned:saned for the appropriate user:group combination.

 Running saned as a standalone daemon
 ------------------------------------

When run as a standalone daemon, saned can advertise its services over the
network, and the SANE clients will automatically discover the saned servers
(provided the clients support this).

To run saned as a standalone server:
  - if you were previously running saned from inetd, disable it (see above)
  - run dpkg-reconfigure sane-utils
