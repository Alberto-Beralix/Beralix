The code of D3DES has the following copyright notice:

    This is D3DES (V5.09) by Richard Outerbridge with the double and
    triple-length support removed for use in VNC.  Also the bytebit[] array
    has been reversed so that the most significant bit in each byte of the
    key is ignored, not the least significant.

    Thanks to: Dan Hoey for his excellent Initial and Inverse permutation
    code;  Jim Gillogly & Phil Karn for the DES key schedule code; Dennis
    Ferguson, Eric Young and Dana How for comparing notes; and Ray Lau,
    for humouring me on.
