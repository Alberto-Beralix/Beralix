INTRODUCTION

Sessioninstaller allows applications to easily install additional software 
(e.g. extensions or GSreamer codecs), to uninstall files and to perform simple
software status queries by implementing the distribution neutral D-Bus session
interface of PackageKit.

The whole process of confirmation, error reporting and progress notification
is handled by sessioninstaller.

The reference implementation of the D-Bus interface can be found in 
gnome-packagekit. It was also adpoted by KPackageKit.

In contrast to gnome-packagekit and KPackageKit it doesn't use the PackageKit
daemon for querying and installation, but instead makes use of APT and 
aptdaemon (alternatively synaptic can be used).

STATUS

The following list shows the implementation status of each interface method.

 * org.freedesktop.PackageKit.Query:

   - IsInstalled: Fully supported

   - SearchFile: Only allows to search for installed files by default, but can
     make use of apt-file to search for not installed files
 
 * org.freedesktop.PackageKit.Modify:

   - InstallPackageFile: Works with aptdaemon backend. Problem with handling
     multiple files.

   - InstallProvideFiles: Not supported. Could be implemented using apt-file.

   - InstallCatalogs: Only supports catalogs which use InstallPackages

   - InstallPackageNames: Fully supported.

   - InstallMimeTypes: Fully supported. Requires appinstall-data.

   - InstallFontConfigResources: Not supported. There in't any package font
     mapping available in Debian and Ubuntu.

   - InstallGStreamerResources: Fully supported.

The interaction mode which allows to hide certain confirmations and dialogs
