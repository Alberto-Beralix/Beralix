 The original code (in XFree86 3.9Nd) was inspired by the Linux I2C
 driver written by Gerd Knorr and others in 1998, but the code differs
 enough that it seems likely no verbatim copying took place.  A
 second-hand account[1] indicates that Michael Schimek’s contribution
 was not copied from Linux:

 The following comment caught my attention:
 .

  * the I2C driver from the Linux kernel.

 It shows up in 2 files:
 X11R7.1/xorg-server-1.1.1/hw/xfree86/i2c/xf86i2c.c
 X11R7.1/xorg-server-1.1.1/hw/xfree86/i2c/xf86i2cmodule.c
 .
 This may be ok, but I thought it worth looking into.
 I managed to get in touch with Michael, and he verified that
 none of his contributions were derived from Linux.
 I haven't been able to contact Itai or Gerd.

 Michael Schimek continued to improve the module through 1999.
 The changes since then have been small bug fixes.
