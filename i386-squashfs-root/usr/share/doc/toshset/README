    Toshset is a command-line tool allowing access to much of the
Toshiba hardware interface. It can do things like control
display brightness, set the fan speed, and enable the optional
Bluetooth interface. 

    Credit for the difficult task of reverse-engineering the Toshiba
hardware interface goes to others, principly Jonathan Buzzard.

The toshset home page is

A link for Jonathan's tools is

To build an executable: 

./configure
make
make install

For command-line options, try toshset with no command-line options.

Comments, suggestions, and the output of toshset -v -q are welcome.

Support for the Toshiba hardware kernel interface: uncommenting the
appropriate line in the Makefile enables USE_KERNEL_INTERFACE. In its
current incarnation, when compiled with this option, toshset first
tries the kernel interface before attempting to talk directly to the
BIOS. This will likely evolve a bit. The justification for this
option: operation under ACPI. Hopefully, the toshiba kernel interface
will soon support ACPI, and with it toshset.

This program is a work in progress. Because Toshiba has not published
its hardware specifications, Jonathan's task of reverse-engineering is
an ongoing process.
