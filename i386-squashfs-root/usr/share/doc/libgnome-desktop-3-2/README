gnome-desktop
=============

gnome-desktop contains the libgnome-desktop library, the gnome-about
program as well as some desktop-wide documents.

The libgnome-desktop library provides API shared by several applications
on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
reasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our
best to provide stability. Documentation for the API is available with
gtk-doc.

The gnome-about program helps find which version of GNOME is installed.

You may download updates to the package from:

   http://download.gnome.org/sources/gnome-desktop/

To discuss gnome-desktop, you may use the desktop-devel-list mailing
list:

Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'. If you are not using a released version of
gnome-desktop (for example, if you checked out the code from git), you
first need to run './autogen.sh'.
