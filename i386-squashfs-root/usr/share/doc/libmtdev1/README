mtdev - Multitouch Protocol Translation Library (MIT license)

The mtdev library transforms all variants of kernel MT events to the
slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev may be from any MT
device, specifically type A without contact tracking, type A with
contact tracking, or type B with contact tracking. See the kernel
documentation for further details.
