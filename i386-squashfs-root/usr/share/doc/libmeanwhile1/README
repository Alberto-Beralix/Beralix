Meanwhile is a library for connecting to a LIM (Lotus Instant
Messaging, formerly Lotus Sametime, formerly VPBuddy) community. It
uses a protocol based in part off of the IMPP draft(*1), and in part
off of traces of TCP sessions from existing clients.

Meanwhile-python is a set of Python wrappers for the Meanwhile library

The gaim-meanwhile plugin allows Gaim to connect to a Lotus Sametime
(tm) community using a compiled-in version of libMeanwhile.
