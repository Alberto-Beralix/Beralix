The purpose of these tests are to check on catalog resolution problems.

All tests are set to run with 'xmllint' and 'nsgmls'.

It is expected to see some warnings about the DTDs such as:
  unused parameter entity "tbl.table.name"
These are real problems in the upstream DocBook DTDs.

The files "test-<VER>.xml" test the proper combination of formal
public identifier (FPI) and system identifier (SI).

The files "test-bad-si-<VER>.xml" test a proper FPI but a bad SI.

The files "test-legacy-si-<VER>.xml" test the old location of the SI
under /usr/share/sgml/dtd/docbook, with no FPI at all.  This is to
ensure that we support people pointing to the old location.
