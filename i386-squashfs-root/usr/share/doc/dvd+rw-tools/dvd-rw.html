	it<TT>:-)</TT></TR>

<P><TABLE CELLPADDING=4>
<TR VALIGN="top" ALIGN="justify">
<TH>Q.	<TH ALIGN="left">What is the difference between these recording
	strategies? Which one is the one for me?</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top" ALIGN="justify">
<TD>A.	<TD><P ALIGN="justify">Disk-at-once is the one
	<I>guaranteed</I> to provide <I>full</I> compatibility with
	DVD-ROM/-Video. But apparently only as long as recording didn't
	suffer from buffer underruns (see <A
	HREF="../#plusvsminus">this paragraph on +RW page</A> for
	technical details). DAO recordings are unappendable. Oh! It
	should be explicitly noted that &quot;<I>full</I> compatibility
	with DVD-Video&quot; doesn't really mean that DVD-R<B>W</B>
	media recorded in this mode will be <I>universally</I>
	playable! DVD-RW reportedly suffers from compatibility issues
	very similar to DVD+RW. In other words these incompatibilities,
	both -RW and +RW, have way more to do with low reflectivity of
	these media, than with their logical formats.

	<P ALIGN="justify">As for Incremental strategy [limited]
	DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility is provided at single
	packet/extent &quot;level.&quot; Good news are that growisofs
	burns the whole filesystem image as a single extent, so that
	you have all the rights to expect it to come out as compatible
	as DAO recorded with [eventual] buffer underruns. Yes, buffer
	underrun protection gets engaged, so that you don't have to
	worry about how much <I>extra</I> load your system can sustain
	during the burning process. In addition Incremental strategy
	provides for <I>multiple sessions</I> and dvd+rw-tools do
	utilize it. But you should keep in mind that very few DVD-ROM
	players actually support DVD multi-sessioning! Even among those
	explicitly supporting DVD-R most will play till the first
	Border-out only.

	<P ALIGN="justify">Restricted Overwrite (DVD-RW only) provides
	for arbitrary overwrite (well, with certain restrictions:-),
	meaning that it's possible to grow ISO9660 volumes <I>within a
	&quot;single session,&quot;</I> in the very same way as with
	DVD+RW (or -RAM/plain file for that matter). So that <I>if</I>
	your DVD-ROM unit can play media recorded in this mode (it most
	likely just does as long as it can play DVD-RW at all), but
	doesn't support multi-sessioning, then this is the mode for you
	(provided that you wish to add data at different occasions that
	is). Buffer underrun protection is unconditionally on. As for
	compatibility with DVD-ROM/-Video. Apparently user Data Zone is
	equivalent to one recorded in DAO, but as if every 32KB block
	has suffered from buffer underrun.

	<P ALIGN="justify">Disk-at-once and Incremental recording
	strategies are applicabe to DVD-R media and DVD-RW media in
	Sequential mode. Restricted Overwrite strategy is applicable to
	DVD-RW media explicitely formated for Restricted
	Overwrite.</TR>

<TH>Q.	<TH ALIGN="left">How do I switch between DVD-RW modes?</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top" ALIGN="justify">
<TD>A.	<TD><P ALIGN="justify">Initially blank DVD-RW media is in
	Sequential mode. To format for Restricted Overwrite invoke
	'<TT><NOBR>dvd+rw-format</NOBR> /dev/scd<FONT
	COLOR="red">N</FONT></TT>'. <!--Unfortunately this might turn
	out to be a lengthy procedure, it takes a whole hour to format
	1x media<NOBR>:-(</NOBR> &quot;Might&quot; in the last sentence
	means that even though dvd+rw-format attempts to invoke so
	called Quick Format procedure, some units apparently choose to
	perform full format anyway. On the bright side,--> Once the
	media is formatted you don't have to reformat it to zap the
	content, it's more than enough to simply write over the
	existing data [with <TT>growisofs -Z ...</TT>]. <!--If your
	unit supports truly Quick Format, it--> Your unit might report
	some bogus media capacity (e.g. Pioneer DVR-x05 reports ~8GB or
	178.5% of real capacity) right after initial format. It
	apparently just does so till you burn some data on it, so don't
	get fixated on this...

	<P ALIGN="justify">To change [back] to Sequential mode [or to
	reuse the media in Sequential mode for a new dataset] invoke
	'<TT><NOBR>dvd+rw-format</NOBR> -blank /dev/scd<FONT
	COLOR="red">N</FONT></TT>'. Unfortunately specification
	requires <I>lengthy, an hour per 1x media,</I>
	<TT>-blank=full</TT> procedure applied <!--(which is as lengthy
	as full format)--> before you can reuse the media for
	Incremental Sequential (but apparently not for Disk-at-once)
	recording. I really fail to understand why does it have to be
	that way, but that's the way it is. Period.</TR>

<TH>Q.	<TH ALIGN="left">Any [other] caveats?</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top" ALIGN="justify">
<TD>A.	<TD><P ALIGN="justify">When burning DVD-R[W] growisofs
	recognizes an extra command line option, namely
	<TT>-speed=<FONT COLOR="red">X</FONT></TT>, which lets you
	choose the burning speed. If you use brand-name media, you're
	unlikely to have to use this option. Your unit will determine
	optimal velocity automagically. But if you use no-name media,
	<TT>-speed=1</TT> might turn out to be a must. Problem is that
	some units reportedly fail to determine optimal speed for
	no-name media and pick higher one, higher than media can stand,
	which results in unplayable recording. This may vary from
	firmware to firmware (Pioneer users should consult <A
	HREF="http://www.pioneeraus.com.au/multimedia/dvd/dvd-r_writing_speed_cl.htm">this
	page</A>).

	<P ALIGN="justify">As for -speed option in more general sense.
	You might find yourself in situation when media rated as 4x is
	recorded at lower speed, even if you explicitly specify
	-speed=4. This is because that particular brand is poorly
	supported by your particular unit firmware. It's not an
	application problem, as growisofs asks unit for list of
	supported velocities for currently loaded media and picks
	<I>closest</I> to one specified in command line. The list is
	updated upon every media load and can be found in
	<NOBR>dvd+rw-mediainfo</NOBR> output.

	<P ALIGN="justify">Futhermore quoting <A
	HREF="http://sony.storagesupport.com/dvdrw/mediainfo_na.htm">SONY
	support page</A>: &quot;... some of discs on the market do not
	meet the recognized quality and performance standards.&quot;
	Question is how does it show? Apparently in bizarre ways...
	DVD-RW media might [reportedly] perform as write-once or maybe
	twice or three times. Blank/format procedure might appear
	successful, but deferred failure is reported upon actual
	recording attempt. It might be possible to blank the media in
	one unit, but not in another one [of different brand]. DVD-R
	recording might [reportedly] fail around 95% of advertised
	capacity... Or recording might fail at start-up with
	&quot;INCOMPATIBLE MEDIUM&quot; error code. At all these
	occasions switching to another media brand [reportedly] helped.

	<P ALIGN="justify">As for DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility of
	Restricted Overwrite mode. Playability might be limited for
	reasons <I>similar</I> to DVD+ lead-out issues (see from <A
	HREF="../#compat">2nd paragraph</A>), when legacy unit is
	tricked to calibration on virgin surface. In case you find
	media recorded in this mode unplayable, attempt to
	<OL>
	<LI>fill it up with '<TT>growisofs <FONT COLOR="red">-M</FONT>
	/dev/scd0<FONT COLOR="red">=/dev/zero</FONT></TT>', and if it
	still remains unplayable attempt to;
	<LI>re-record it &quot;sequentially.&quot;
	</OL>
	<P ALIGN="justify">In order to facilitate for the latter test
	and be excused from wasting an hour on full blanking procedure,
	growisofs version 5.6 implements rudimentary support for DVD-RW
	DAO recordings (yes, for DVD-RW only). Recall that DAO
	recordings come out unappendable, which goes so to say against
	growisofs' spirit:-)

	<P ALIGN="justify">As of version 5.6 growisofs no longer relies
	on logical unit to do all the magic, but explicitly asks the
	burner to perform OPC, Optimal Power Calibration, prior
	recording. It seems that it's not necessarily a &quot;good
	thing&trade;,&quot; as it's maintained that media profiles
	pre-defined in unit firmware might be more optimal than those
	obtained as result of auto-calibration. I explicitly check if
	the unit returns any OPC descriptors in reply to <TT>READ DISC
	INFORMATION</TT> command [assuming that if it does, then
	pre-defined media profile is in effect], but it wasn't actually
	observed to be a case so far. If anybody can elaborate on this
	further, I appreciate a note...</TR>
