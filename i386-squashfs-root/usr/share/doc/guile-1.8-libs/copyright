This is the Debian package of GNU Guile, downloaded from
ftp.gnu.org/pub/guile.

Guile itself is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, which you can find in /usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL.

The Guile Tutorial (info guile-tut) is licensed as follows:

  Permission is granted to make and distribute verbatim copies of
  this manual provided the copyright notice and this permission notice
  are preserved on all copies.

  Permission is granted to copy and distribute modified versions of this
  manual under the conditions for verbatim copying, provided that the entire
  resulting derived work is distributed under the terms of a permission
  notice identical to this one.

  Permission is granted to copy and distribute translations of this manual
  into another language, under the above conditions for modified versions,
  except that this permission notice may be stated in a translation approved
  by the author.

The Guile NEWS file is licensed as follows:

  Permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute verbatim copies
  of this document as received, in any medium, provided that the
  copyright notice and this permission notice are preserved,
  thus giving the recipient permission to redistribute in turn.

  Permission is granted to distribute modified versions
  of this document, or of portions of it,
  under the above conditions, provided also that they
  carry prominent notices stating who last changed them.

Some of the Guile documentation has been removed from this package
because its license terms do not appear to satisfy the requirements of
the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See
http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

In particular, some of the info pages are covered under the GNU Free
Documentation License, which Debian has decided does not satisfy the
DFSG in cases where "Invariant Sections" are specified (this includes
front and back cover texts).  See this Debian General Resolution on
the topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

Some other files have been removed because their license only allows
verbatim copying, or because there was some other question.
