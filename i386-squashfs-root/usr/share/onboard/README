Onboard 0.95.1
--------------

Description:

    Onboard is an onscreen keyboard useful for everybody that cannot use a
    hardware keboard; for example TabletPC users, mobility impaired users,...

    It has been designed with simplicity in mind and can be used right away
    without the need of any configuration, as it can read the keyboard layout
    from the X server. 

    Among its features are:
    - Support of custom layouts through the use of xml and svg files.
    - Support of custom themes for the appearance through the use of xml files.
    - Support of macros to automatically type custom defined texts.
    - Support of <modifier>+<mouseclick> combination.
    - Toggling mouse buttons to perform right clicks with the left mouse button.
    - Minimizing the keyboard to the panel, a trayicon, or a floating icon.
    - Rudimentary support for scanning.
