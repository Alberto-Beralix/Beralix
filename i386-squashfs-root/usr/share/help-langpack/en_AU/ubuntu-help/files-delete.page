<title>Delete files and folders</title>

<p>
If you don't want a file or folder any more, you can delete it.
</p>

<p>When you delete an item it is moved to the Rubbish Bin folder, where it is stored until you empty the rubbish bin. Items stored in the Rubbish Bin folder can be <link xref="files-recover">restored to their original location</link> if you decide you need them, or if they were accidentally deleted.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Select the item you want to delete by clicking it once.</p></item>
  <item><p>Press <key>Delete</key> on your keyboard. Alternatively, drag the item to the <gui>Rubbish Bin</gui> in the sidebar.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>To delete files permanently, and to free up disk space on your computer, you need to empty the rubbish bin. To empty the rubbish bin, right-click <gui>Rubbish Bin</gui> in the sidebar and select <gui>Empty Rubbish Bin</gui>. Alternatively, you can permanently delete individual items in the rubbish by navigating to the rubbish bin from the sidebar or the <gui>Go</gui> menu. Select files you want to delete permanently and press <key>Delete</key> on your keyboard, or right-click and select <gui>Delete Permanently</gui>.</p>

<note><p>Deleted files on a <link xref="files#removable">removable device</link> may not be visible on other operating systems, such Windows or Mac OS. The files are still there, and will be available when you plug the device back into your computer.</p></note>

 <title>Permanently delete a file</title>
<p>You can immediately delete a file permanently, without having to
send it to the trash first.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Select the item you want to delete.</p></item>
  <item><p>Press and hold the <gui>Shift</gui> key, then press the <key>Delete</key> key on your keyboard.</p></item>
  <item><p>Because you cannot undo this, you will be asked to
  confirm that you want to delete the file or folder.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>If you frequently need to delete files without using the trash
(for example, if you often work with sensitive data), you can add
a <gui>Delete</gui> entry to the right-click menu for files and
folders. Click <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq>
and select the <gui>Behavior</gui> tab. Select <gui>Include a Delete
command that bypasses Trash</gui>.</p>
