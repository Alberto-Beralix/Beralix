<title>Adjust the double-click speed</title>

<p>Double-clicking only happens when you press the mouse button twice
quickly enough. If the second press is too long after the first, you'll
just get two separate clicks, not a double click. If you have difficulty
pressing the mouse button so quickly, you should increase the timeout.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>top panel</gui> and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Mouse and Touchpad</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Under <gui>Double-Click Timeout</gui>, adjust the <gui>Timeout</gui> slider to a value you find comfortable. Use the smiley face under the slider to test your settings. A single click will make it smile. A double-click will give it an ear-to-ear grin.</p></item>
</steps>

<note>
<p>If your mouse double-clicks when you want it to single-click
even though you have increased the double-click timeout, 
your mouse may be faulty. Try plugging a different mouse into your computer 
and see if that works properly. Alternatively, plug your mouse into a 
different computer and see if it still has the same problem.
