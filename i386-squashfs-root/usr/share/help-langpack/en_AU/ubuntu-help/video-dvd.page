<title>Why won't DVDs play?</title>

<p>If you insert a DVD into your computer and it won't play, you may not have the right DVD "codecs" installed, or the DVD might be from a different "region".</p>

<section id="codecs">
 <title>Installing the right codecs for DVD playback</title>
 <p>In order to play DVDs, you need to have the right <em>codecs</em> installed. A codec is some software that allows applications to read a video or audio format. If you try to play a DVD and don't have the right codecs installed, the Movie Player should tell you about this and offer to install it for you.</p>
 <p>DVDs are also "copy-protected" using a system called CSS. This prevents you from copying DVDs, but it also prevents you from playing them unless you have some <link xref="video-dvd-restricted">extra software</link> to handle the copy protection.</p>

<section id="region">
 <title>Checking the DVD region</title>
 <p>DVDs have a "region code", which tells you in which region of the world you are allowed to play the DVD. DVD players can only play DVDs from the same region as them. For example, if you have a region 1 DVD player, you will only be allowed to play DVDs from North America.</p>
 <p>If the region of your computer's DVD player and the DVD you are trying to play do not match, you won't be able to play the DVD. It is often possible to change the region used by your DVD player, but you can only do this a few times before it locks into one region permanently.</p>
 <p>To change the DVD region of your computer's DVD player, use <link href="apt:regionset">regionset</link>.</p>
