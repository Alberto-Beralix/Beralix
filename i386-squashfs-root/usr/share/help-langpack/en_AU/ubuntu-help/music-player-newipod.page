<title>My new iPod won't work</title>

<p>If you have a new iPod that has never been connected to a computer before, it won't be recognized properly when you connect it to a Linux computer. This is because iPods need to be set up and updated using the <app>iTunes</app> software, which only runs on Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>To set-up your iPod, install iTunes on a Windows or Mac computer and plug it in. You will be led through a few steps to set it up. When asked for the <gui>Volume Format</gui>, choose <gui>MS-DOS (FAT)</gui>, <gui>Windows</gui> or similar. The other format does not work as well with Linux.</p>

<p>Once you have finished setup, the iPod should work normally when you plug it into a Linux computer.</p>
