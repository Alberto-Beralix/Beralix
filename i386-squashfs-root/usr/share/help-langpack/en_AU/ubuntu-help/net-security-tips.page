<title>Staying safe on the internet</title>

<p>A reason why you may be using Linux is for the robust security that it is known for. One reason 
Linux is relatively safe from malware and viruses is due to the number of people that use it.
Viruses are targeted at popular operating systems like Windows that have an extremely massive 
user base. Linux is also very secure due to its open source nature which allows experts 
to modify and enhance the security features included with each distribution.</p>

<p>Despite the measures taken to ensure your installation of Linux is secure, there
are always vulnerabilities. As an average user on the internet you are still susceptible to:</p>

  <item><p>Phishing Scams (Sites that try to obtain sensitive information through deception)</p></item>
  <item><p><link xref="net-email-virus">Forwarding malicious emails</link></p></item>
  <item><p><link xref="net-antivirus">Applications with malicious intents (Viruses)</link></p></item>
  <item><p><link xref="net-wireless-wepwpa">Unwarranted remote/local network access</link></p></item>
 </list>

<p>To stay safe from malicious exploits, keep in mind the following tips:</p>

 <list>
  <item><p>Do not open emails, attachments, or links that were sent from people you do not know.</p></item>
  <item><p>If a website's offer is too good to be true or asks for sensitive information
that seems unnecessary, then think twice about what you are submitting and the potential 
consequences if that information is compromised by identity thieves or other criminals.</p></item>
  <item><p>Be careful in providing any application root level permissions, especially ones that 
you have not used before or apps that are not well-known. Providing anyone/anything with root level 
permissions puts your computer at high risk to exploitation.</p></item>
  <item><p>Make sure you are only running necessary remote-access services. Having <app>SSH</app> or <app>VNC</app> running can be useful but also leaves your computer open to intrusion if not secured properly. Consider using a <link xref="net-firewall-on-off">firewall</link> to help protect your computer from intrusion.</p></item>
