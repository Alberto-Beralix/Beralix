  <title>What's the difference between calibration and characterisation?</title>
  <p>Many people are initially confused about the difference between calibration and characterisation. Calibration is the process of modifying the colour behaviour of a device. This is typically done using two mechanisms:</p>
  <list>
    <item><p>Changing controls or internal settings that it has</p></item>
    <item><p>Applying curves to its color channels</p></item>
  </list>
  <p>The idea of calibration is to put a device is a defined state with regard to its colour response. Often this is used as a day to day means of maintaining reproducible behaviour. Typically calibration will be stored in device or systems specific file formats that record the device settings or per-channel calibration curves.</p>
  <p>Characterisation (or profiling) is <em>recording</em> the way a device reproduces or responds to colour. Typically the result is stored in a device ICC profile. Such a profile does not in itself modify colour in any way. It allows a system such as a CMM (Colour Management Module) or a colour aware application to modify colour when combined with another device profile. Only by knowing the characteristics of two devices, can a way of transferring colour from one device representation to another be achieved.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Note that a characterisation (profile) will only be valid for a device if it is in the same state of calibration as it was when it was characterised.</p>
  </note>
  <p>In the case of display profiles there is some additional confusion because often the calibration information is stored in the profile for convenience. By convention it is stored in a tag called the <em>vcgt</em> tag. Although it is stored in the profile, none of the normal ICC based tools or applications are aware of it, or do anything with it. Similarly, typical display calibration tools and applications will not be aware of, or do anything with the ICC characterisation (profile) information.</p>
