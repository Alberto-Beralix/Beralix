<title>File manager views preferences</title>
<p>You can control the default view for new folders, how files and folders
are sorted by default, the zoom level for the icon and compact views, and
whether files are displayed in the tree sidebar. In any file manager window,
click <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq> and select the
<gui>Views</gui> tab.</p>

<title>Default view</title>

  <item>
    <title><gui>View new folders using</gui></title>
    <p>By default, new folders are shown in icon view. You can select a view
    for each folder as you browse, and the file manager will remember which
    view you prefer for each folder. But if you often use the list or compact
    views, you can use these views by default.</p>
    <p>Change the view for an individual folder from the <gui>View</gui> menu
    by clicking <gui>Icons</gui>, <gui>List</gui>, or <gui>Compact</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><gui>Arrange items</gui></title>
    <p>You can arrange the items in your folder by name, file size, file type,
    when they were last modified, when they were last accessed, or when they
    were trashed. You can change how files are sorted in an individual folder
    using the <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Arrange Items</gui></guiseq> menu,
    or by clicking the list column headers in list view. See <link xref="files-sort"/>
    for details. This menu only affects the current folder, and the file manager
    will remember your preferred sorting technique for each folder.</p>
    <p>Use the <gui>Arrange items</gui> drop-down list in the preferences
    to change the default order used in new folders.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><gui>Sort folders before files</gui></title>
    <p>By default, the file manager will show all folders before files. Folders
    and files will each be arranged according to the selected sort order. If
    you would rather not treat folders specially and have them mixed with files
    according to the sort order, select this option.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><gui>Show hidden and backup files</gui></title>
    <p>The file manager does not display hidden files or folders by default.
    See <link xref="files-hidden"/> for information on hidden files. You can
    show hidden files in an individual window from the <gui>View</gui> menu.
    If you prefer to always show hidden files, or want to see hidden files
    in every open file manager window, select this option.</p>

   <item>
    <title><gui>Default zoom level</gui></title>
    <p>You can make the icons and text larger or smaller in icon view. You can
    do this in an individual folder from the <gui>View</gui> menu, and the file
    manager will remember your zoom choice for each folder. If you frequently use
    a larger or smaller zoom level, you can set the default with this option.</p>
    <p>In icon view, more or fewer captions are shown based on your zoom level.
    See <link xref="nautilus-display#icon-captions"/> for more information.</p>
   </item>
   <item>
    <title><gui>Text beside icons</gui></title>
    <p>Selecting this option will place folder and file names to the right
    of icons, rather than below them. This is a more compact layout that
    allows you to see more information at once.</p>
   </item>
  </terms>

<section id="compact-view-defaults">
 <title>Compact view defaults</title>

  <terms>
   <item>
    <title><gui>Default zoom level</gui></title>
    <p>You can make the icons and text larger or smaller in compact view. You can
    do this in an individual folder from the <gui>View</gui> menu, and the file
    manager will remember your zoom choice for each folder. If you frequently use
    a larger or smaller zoom level, you can set the default with this option.</p>
   </item>
   <item>
    <title><gui>All columns have the same width</gui></title>
    <p>By default, each column in compact view is as wide as it needs to be to
    fit the names of the items in that column. Selecting this option will make
    all the columns have the same width.  This will make files and folders that
    have names longer than the column width be displayed with an ellipsis (...)
    at the end.</p>

<title>Tree view defaults</title>
<p>You can show a full folder tree in your file manager sidebar by selecting <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Sidebar</gui><gui>Tree</gui></guiseq>. By default, the tree sidebar only shows folders. If you want to show files in the sidebar as well, turn <gui>Show only folders</gui> off.</p>
