  <title>What is a colour space?</title>

  <p>A colour space is a defined range of colours. Well known colour spaces include sRGB, AdobeRGB and ProPhotoRGB.</p>

  <p>The human visual system is not a simple RGB sensor, but we can approximate how the eye responds with a CIE 1931 chromacity diagram that shows the human visual response as a horse-shoe shape. You can see that in human vision there is many more shades of green detected than blue or red. With a trichromatic colour space like RGB we represent the colours on the computer using three values, which restricts up to encoding a <em>triangle</em> of colours.</p>

  <note>
    <p>Using models such as a CIE 1931 chromacity diagram is a huge simplification of the human visual system, and real gamuts are expressed as 3D hulls, rather than 2D projections. A 2D projection of a 3D shape can sometimes be misleading, so if you want to see the 3D hull, use the <code>gcm-viewer</code> application.</p>

  <p>First, looking at sRGB, which is the smallest space and can encode the least number of colours. It it an approximation of a 10 year old CRT display, and so most modern monitors can easily display more colours than this. sRGB is a standard <em>least-common-denominator</em> standard and is used in a large number of applications (including the Internet).</p>
  <p>AbodeRGB is frequently used as an <em>editing space</em>. It can encode more colours than sRGB, and means you adjust colours in a photograph without worrying too much that the brightest colours are being clipped or the blacks crushed.</p>
  <p>PhoPhoto is the largest space available and is frequently used for document archival. It can encode nearly the whole range of colours detected by the human eye, and even encode colours that the eye cannot detect!</p>

  <p>Now, if PhoPhoto is clearly better, why don't we use it for everything? The answer is to do with <em>quantisation</em>. If you only have 8 bits (256 levels) to encode each channel, then a larger range is going to have bigger steps between each value.</p>
  <p>Bigger steps mean a larger error between the captured colour and the stored colour, and for some colours this is a big problem. It turns out that key colours, like skin colours are very important, and even small errors will make untrained viewers notice that something in a photograph looks wrong.</p>
  <p>Of course, using a 16 bit image is going to leave many more steps and a much smaller quantisation error, but this doubles the size of each image file. Most content in existence today is 8bpp, i.e. 8 bits-per-pixel.</p>
  <p>Colour management is a process for converting from one colour space to another, where a colour space can be a well known defined space like sRGB, or a custom space such as your monitor or printer profile.</p>
