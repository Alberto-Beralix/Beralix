  <title>Remove an application</title>

    <p>The <app>Ubuntu Software Center</app> makes it easy to remove software that you no longer use.</p>
    
    <steps>
    <item>
        <p>Click on the <app>Software Center</app> icon in the <gui>Launcher</gui>, or open 
        the <gui>Dash</gui>, and search for <app>Software Center</app>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>When the <app>Software Center</app> opens, click on <gui>Installed Software</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <p>In the <em>Installed Software</em> section, find the application that you want to remove by finding it in 
        the list or by searching for it.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <p>Select the application and click <gui>Remove</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <p>You may be asked to enter your password. After you have done that, the application will be removed. 
        This should not take very long.</p>
    </item>
    </steps>
    <note><p>
    Some applications depend on others being installed in order to work 
    properly. If you try to remove an application which is needed by another 
    application, both of them will be removed. You will be asked 
    to confirm that this is what you want to happen before the applications 
    are removed.
    </p></note>
    <p>For more information about using the <app>Ubuntu Software Center</app>, consult the 
    <link href="ghelp:software-center">Ubuntu Software Center Manual</link>.</p>
    <p>
    If the application that you want to remove is not available in the 
    <app>Ubuntu Software Center</app>, use <link xref="addremove-install-synaptic">Synaptic
    </link> to remove it instead.
