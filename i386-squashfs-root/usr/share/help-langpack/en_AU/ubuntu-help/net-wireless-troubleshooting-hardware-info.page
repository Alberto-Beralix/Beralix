<title>Gather information about your hardware</title>

  <p>To best troubleshoot your wireless connection you will need some items and some information. Although you might not have all of these items, collect what you can:</p>
    <list>
      <item><p>Your laptop and wireless router (of course!)</p></item>
      <item><p>The packaging and contents for your device (particularly the user guide for your router)</p></item>
      <item><p>A driver disc - even if it only contains Windows drivers</p></item>
      <item><p>If possible, have access to an alternate working internet connection for downloading software and drivers</p></item>
    </list>

  <p>It is also helpful to have the following information available. Again, just collect what you can:</p>
    <list>
      <item><p>The name of the manufacturer for your computer, wireless adapter and router</p></item>
      <item><p>The complete model number of your computer and router</p></item>
      <item><p>Any version numbers that may be printed on your devices or their packaging. These can be especially helpful, so look carefully.</p></item>
      <item><p>Anything on the driver disc that identifies either the device itself or the components it uses. Wireless implementation chips are often operated by firmware, a type of software written specifically for that chip.</p></item>
    </list>
 <p>Once you have these items and this information, click <gui>Next</gui> in the upper-right portion of this page to continue.</p>
