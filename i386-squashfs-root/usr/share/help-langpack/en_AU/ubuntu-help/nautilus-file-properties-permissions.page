  <title>Set file permissions</title>

  <p>You can use file permissions control who can view and edit files that
  you own. To view and set the permissions for a file, right click it and
  select <gui>Properties</gui>, then select the <gui>Permissions</gui> tab.</p>

  <p>See <link xref="#files"/> and <link xref="#folders"/> below for details
  on the types of permissions you can set.</p>

  <section id="files">
    <title>Files</title>

    <p>You can set the permissions for the file owner, the group owner,
    and all other users of the system. For your files, you are the owner,
    and you can give yourself read-only or read-and-write permission.
    Set a file to read-only if you don't want to accidentally change it.</p>

    <p>Every user on your computer belongs to a group. On home computers,
    it is common for each user to have their own group, and group permissions
    are not often used. In corporate environments, groups are sometimes used
    for departments or projects. As well as having an owner, each file belongs
    to a group. You can set the file's group and control the permissions for
    all users in that group. You can only set the file's group to a group you
    belong to.</p>

    <p>You can also set the permissions for users other than the owner and
    those in the file's group.</p>

    <p>If the file is a program, such as a script, you must select <gui>Allow
    executing file as program</gui> to run it. Even with this option selected,
    the file manager may still open the file in an application or ask you
    what to do. See <link xref="nautilus-behavior#executable"/> for more
    information.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="folders">
    <title>Folders</title>
    <p>You can set permissions on folders for the owner, group, and other users.
    See the details of file permissions above for an explanation of owners,
    groups, and other users.</p>
    <p>The permissions you can set for a folder are different from those you
    can set for a file.</p>
    <terms>
      <item>
        <title><gui>None</gui></title>
        <p>The user will not even be able to see what files are in
        the folder.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <title><gui>List files only</gui></title>
        <p>The user will be able to see what files are in the folder,
        but will not be able to open, create, or delete files.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <title><gui>Access files</gui></title>
        <p>The user will be able to open files in the folder (provided
        they have permission to do so on the particular file), but will
        not be able to create new files or delete files.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <title><gui>Create and delete files</gui></title>
        <p>The user will have full access to the directory, including
        opening, creating, and deleting files.</p>
      </item>
    </terms>

    <p>You can also quickly set the file permissions for all the files
    in the folder by using the <gui>File access</gui> drop-down lists
    and the <gui>Execute</gui> option. Leave the drop-down lists as
    <gui>---</gui> for no change, or the <gui>Execute</gui> check box
    in the indeterminate state (a horizontal line across it).</p>
    <p>If you click <gui>Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files</gui>, the
    file manager will adjust the read, write, and execute permissions of
    contained files based on the <gui>File access</gui> and <gui>Execute</gui>
    options you set. It will also change the permissions of contained folders
    to match the permissions of that folder. Permissions for enclosed files
    are applied to files in subfolders as well, to any depth.</p>
