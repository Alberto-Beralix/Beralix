<title>Change the desktop background</title>

<p>You can change the image used on your desktop background, or set
it to a simple color or gradient.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Right click on the desktop and select <gui>Change Desktop Background</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select an image or colour. The settings are applied immediately. <link xref="shell-workspaces-switch">Switch to an empty workspace</link> to view your entire desktop.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>There are three choices in the drop-down list on the left.</p>

<list>
  <item><p>Select <gui>Wallpapers</gui> to use one of the many professional background images that ship with Ubuntu. With the exception of the Ubuntu wallpaper, all of the default wallpaper choices were created by winners of a Community Wallpaper Contest.</p>
  <p>Some wallpapers are partially transparent and allow a background colour to show through. For these wallpapers, there will be a colour selector button in the bottom right.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select <gui>Pictures Folder</gui> to use one of your own photos from your Pictures folder. Most photo management applications store photos there.</p></item>
  <item><p>You can also select <gui> Colours &amp; Gradients</gui> to just use a flat colour or a linear gradient. Colour selector buttons will appear in the bottom right corner.</p></item>
</list>

<p>You can also browse for any picture on your computer by clicking the <gui>+</gui> button. Any picture you add this way will show up under <gui>Pictures Folder</gui>. You can remove it from the list by selecting it and clicking the <gui>-</gui> button.</p>
