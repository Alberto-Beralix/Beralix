<title>Adjust speed of the mouse and touchpad</title>

<p>If your pointer moves too fast or slow when you move your mouse
or use your touchpad, you can adjust the pointer sensitivity and
acceleration for these devices.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>top panel</gui> and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Mouse and Touchpad</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Adjust the <gui>Acceleration</gui> and <gui>Sensitivity</gui> sliders
  until the pointer motion is comfortable for you. Sensitivity is how much your
  pointer initially moves when you move your mouse.</p>
  <p>The farther you move your
  mouse, the faster and faster the pointer moves relative to your movement.
  This helps you get the pointer across the screen without lifting your hand,
  while still letting you point and click accurately. Acceleration controls
  this behavior.</p></item>
</steps>

<note style="tip">
  <p>You can set the sensitivity and acceleration differently for your mouse and touchpad. Sometimes the most comfortable settings for one type of device aren't the most comfortable for another. Just set the sliders on both the <gui>Mouse</gui> and <gui>Touchpad</gui> tabs.</p>
