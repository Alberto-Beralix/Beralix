  <title>What is a colour profile?</title>

  <p>A colour profile is a set of data that characterises either a device such as a projector or a colour space such as sRGB.</p>
  <p>Most colour profiles are in the form of an ICC profile, which is a small file with a <input>.ICC</input> or <input>.ICM</input> file extension.</p>
  <p>Colour profiles can be embedded into images to specify the gamut range of the data. This ensures that users see the same colours on different devices.</p>
  <p>Every device that is processing colour should have it's own ICC profile and when this is achieved the system is said to have an <em>end-to-end colour-managed workflow</em>. With this kind of workflow you can be sure that colours are not being lost or modified.</p>
