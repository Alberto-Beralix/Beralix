<title>Verbinden mit verborgenen Funknetzwerken</title>

<p>It is possible to set up a wireless network so that it is "hidden." Hidden networks won't show up in the list of networks that are displayed when you click the network menu in the top panel (nor will they appear in the list of wireless networks on any other computer).</p>

<p>To connect to a hidden wireless network, click the <gui>network menu</gui> on the top panel and select <gui>Connect to Hidden Wireless Network</gui>. In the window that appears, type the network name, choose the type of wireless security and click <gui>Connect</gui>.</p>

<p>You may have to check the settings of the wireless base station/router to see what the network name is. It is sometimes called the <em>BSSID</em> (Basic Service Set Identifier), and looks something like this: <gui>02:00:01:02:03:04</gui>.</p>

<p>You should also check the wireless base station's security settings; look for terms like WEP and WPA.</p>

<note>
 <p>You may think that hiding your wireless network will improve security by preventing people who don't know about it from connecting. In practice, this is not the case; the network is slightly harder to find but it is still detectable.</p>
