Description: Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client
        resolver library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box"
        nameserver which can read most BIND-syntax zone files as well as a
        simple Python-based configuration format. Twisted Names can act as an
        authoritative server, perform zone transfers from a master to act as a
        secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or any combination of
        these. Twisted Names' client resolver library provides functions to
        query for all commonly used record types as well as a replacement for
        the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by the Python stdlib
        socket module.
