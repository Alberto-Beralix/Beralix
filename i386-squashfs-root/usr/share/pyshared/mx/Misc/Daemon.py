    """ Kill a process pid and collect it.

        Returns the process exit status or default_exit_status in
        case this cannot be determined.

        Sends the process a SIGTERM signal and waits shutdown_time
        seconds for it to terminate.

        If force is true (default), the process is sent a SIGKILL
        signal if it doesn't terminate after sending the SIGTERM.  The
        function will then wait another kill_time seconds for the
        process to end.

        Raises a ProcessNotStoppedError in case the process cannot be
        terminated.

        log may be set to a mx.Log instance. It defaults to the
        mx.Log.log instance. log_prefix is prefixed to the log
        messages.
