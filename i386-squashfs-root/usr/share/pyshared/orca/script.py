"""Each script maintains a set of key bindings, braille bindings, and
AT-SPI event listeners.  The key bindings are an instance of
KeyBindings.  The braille bindings are also a dictionary where the
keys are BrlTTY command integers and the values are instances of
InputEventHandler.  The listeners field is a dictionary where the keys
are AT-SPI event names and the values are function pointers.

Instances of scripts are intended to be created solely by the
script manager.

This Script class is not intended to be instantiated directly.
Instead, it is expected that subclasses of the Script class will be
created in their own module.  The module defining the Script subclass
is also required to have a 'getScript(app)' method that returns an
instance of the Script subclass.  See default.py for an example."""
