  <link xref="shell-workspaces-switch">Switch to an empty workspace</link>
  to view your entire desktop.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>There are three choices in the drop-down list on the left.</p>

<list>
  <item><p>Select <gui>Wallpapers</gui> to use one of the many professional
  background images that ship with Ubuntu. With the exception of the Ubuntu wallpaper,
  all of the default wallpaper choices were created by winners of a Community 
  Wallpaper Contest.</p>
  <p>Some wallpapers are partially
  transparent and allow a background color to show through. For these
  wallpapers, there will be a color selector button in the bottom right.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select <gui>Pictures Folder</gui> to use one of your own photos
  from your Pictures folder. Most photo management applications
  store photos there.</p></item>
  <item><p>You can also select <gui>Colors &amp; Gradients</gui> to just
  use a flat color or a linear gradient. Color selector buttons will appear
  in the bottom right corner.</p></item>
</list>

<p>You can also browse for any picture on your computer by clicking
the <gui>+</gui> button. Any picture you add this way will show up
under <gui>Pictures Folder</gui>. You can remove it from the list
by selecting it and clicking the <gui>-</gui> button.</p>
