  <title>Change language</title>

    <p>How do you change the system language, i.e. the language of the
    login screen or even the boot process?</p>
  </comment>

  <p>You can use your desktop and applications in any of dozens of languages, provided
  you have the proper language packs installed on your computer.</p>

  <steps>
    <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the top panel and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click <gui>Language Support</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select your desired language on the <gui>Language</gui> tab. Drag the language to the top of the list.</p></item>
    <item><p>You have to log out and back in for language changes to take
    effect. Click the icon at the very right of the panel and select <gui>Log Out</gui>
    to log out.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <note>
    <p>Some translations may be incomplete, and certain applications may not
    support your language at all.</p>
  </note>

  <p>There are some special folders in your home folder where applications
  can store things like music, pictures, and documents. These folders use
  standard names according to your language. When you log back in, you will
  be asked if you want to rename these folders to the standard names for
  your selected language. If you plan to use the new language all the time,
  you should update the folder names.</p>

  <p>You find more detailed guidance on languages and regional formats in
  <link href="ghelp:language-selector">Language Support Help</link>.</p>
