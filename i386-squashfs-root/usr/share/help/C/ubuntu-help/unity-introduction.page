  <title>Welcome to Ubuntu 11.10</title>

<p>Ubuntu 11.10 features <em>Unity</em>, a completely 
reimagined user interface. Unity is designed to minimize distractions, give you more 
room to work, and help you get things done.</p>

<p>This guide is designed to answer your questions about using Unity and your Ubuntu desktop. 
First we will take a moment to look at some Unity's key features, and how you can use them.</p>

</media>

<p>The <gui>Launcher</gui> appears automatically when you log in to your desktop, and
gives you quick access to the applications you use most often. When you launch an 
application, the launcher hides from your view. This gives you more room to do your 
work, and keeps distractions to a minimum. If you move your 
mouse pointer to the left side of the screen, the launcher will appear.</p>

  <title>The Dash</title>

<p>The <gui>Ubuntu Button</gui> sits near the top left corner of the screen and is
always the top item in the launcher.
If you click the <gui>Ubuntu Button</gui>, Unity will present you with 
an additional feature of the desktop, the <gui>Dash</gui>.</p>

<p>The <em>Dash</em> is designed to make it easier to find, open and use applications 
files, and music. For example, if you type the word, "document" in to the <em>Search Bar</em>, 
the Dash will show you applications that help you write and edit documents. It will also show you 
relevant folders and documents that you have been working on recently.</p>

<p>The Dash also gives you shortcuts to often-used Internet, photo, email, and music applications.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning of what the Dash can do for you. If you want to get the most 
out of the Dash, check out the Dash tips-and-tricks.</p>
