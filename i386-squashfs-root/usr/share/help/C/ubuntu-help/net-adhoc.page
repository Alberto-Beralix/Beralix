<title>Connect directly to another computer with a wireless connection</title>

<p>You can connect computers together by forming an <em>ad-hoc</em> wireless network. This is useful if one of the computers has a printer connected to it that you want to share, or if you want to transfer files between them.</p>

<p>With a normal (<em>infrastructure</em>) wireless network, you would connect both computers to a wireless network provided by wireless base station or router. If you don't have a base station, however, an ad-hoc network will still allow you to connect the computers to each other.</p>

<p>To set-up an ad-hoc wireless network:</p>
<steps>
 <item>
  <p>On one of the computers, click the <gui>network menu</gui> on the top panel and select <gui>Edit Connections</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Go to the <gui>Wireless</gui> tab and click <gui>Add</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>In the window that appears, choose a name for the wireless network and then look at the <gui>Wireless</gui> tab.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Choose an <gui>SSID</gui>. This is the name of the network that other people will be able to see.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Change the <gui>Mode</gui> to <gui>Ad-hoc</gui> and leave the other settings at their defaults. Click <gui>Save</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>On the other computer, click the <gui>network indicator</gui> on the top bar and look for a network with the SSID you chose. It might take a minute or two to appear in the list.</p>
  <p>Click the name of your new ad-hoc network to connect to it. Once connected, you will be able to access network shares and so on, like you would if both computers were connected to a conventional wireless network.</p>
 </item>
</steps>

<p>These instructions will be different if one of the computers is not running Linux. You may find it easiest to set-up the ad-hoc network on the Linux computer and connect to it using the other computer.</p>

<p>Also note that some wireless network cards do not support ad-hoc networking, so you will not be able to use them to create an ad-hoc network.</p>

<section id="security">
 <title>Securing an ad-hoc network</title>
 <p>Anyone in the area will be able to connect to your ad-hoc network, so it's not very secure. You can add a <link xref="net-wireless-wepwpa">WEP/WPA password</link> to the network to protect it from unauthorized access.</p>
 
 <p>To add a password:</p>
 
 <steps>
  <item>
   <p>Click the <gui>network menu</gui> on the top panel and click <gui>Edit Connections</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  
  <item>
   <p>Go to the <gui>Wireless</gui> tab, select the ad-hoc wireless network and click <gui>Edit</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  
  <item>
   <p>Go to the <gui>Wireless Security</gui> tab and change the <gui>Security</gui> from <gui>None</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  
  <item>
   <p>Choose your own password and then click <gui>Save</gui>. The other computers connected to the ad-hoc connection will have to reconnect and you'll have to enter the password on each of them.</p>
  </item>
