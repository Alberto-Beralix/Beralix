<title>Window operations and modes</title>

  <p>Make more task-based. Maybe split up. Overview doesn't seem
  as useful as it could be. Revisit hide/minimize terminology.

   Windows work in a very similar way to windows on other operating systems.
</p>

<comment><p>Briefly explain the different window states that exist and how you can use and recognize those states. Discuss interesting ways of arranging windows (i.e. if there is a "Tile" option or something like that). Mention, in passing, how you can move and resize windows in multiple ways.</p></comment>

    <title>Minimize</title>
    <p> To minimize a window, you can:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
       <p>
         Press the button that looks like a "minus" sign in the application's <gui>menu bar</gui>. If the 
         application is maximized (taking up your whole screen), the menu bar will appear at the very top
         of the screen. Otherwise, the minimize button will appear at the top of the application window.
       </p>
       <note>
         <p>When you minizize an application, the application window 'disappears' into the <gui>launcher</gui>. 
         The application can be retrieved by opening the <gui>launcher</gui> and clicking on that 
         application's icon, or by pressing <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>tab</key></keyseq> to cycle through your 
         open applications.

       </p>
      </item>
      <item>
       <p>

<title>Resize a window</title>

<note style="important">
 <p>
   To resize a window, your window first needs to be <em>unmaximized</em>.
 </p>
</note>
<p>
   The simplest way to resize your window in the horizontal and/or vertical direction is to move the mouse pointer up to the top left corner of the window until it changes into a 'corner-pointer'.  When it becomes a 'corner-pointer', click+hold+drag to resize the window in any direction.
</p>

<p>
You can also resize only in the horizontal direction by moving the mouse pointer to the left side of the window until it changes into a 'side-pointer'.   When it becomes a 'side-pointer', click+hold+drag to resize the window in the horizontal direction.
</p>

<p>
To resize in the vertical direction, move the mouse pointer to the top or bottom of the window until it changes into a 'top-pointer' or 'bottom-pointer' respectively.   When it does, click+hold+drag to resize the window in the vertical direction.
</p>

<section id="arrange">
<title>Ways to arrange windows in your workspace</title>
<p>
  You can automatically arrange two windows side by side.  <key>Alt</key> + click and drag one window towards the left until the cursor touches the left side of the screen.  The left half of the screen becomes highlighted.  Unclick, and your window should automatically take up exactly half your screen.  Do the same thing for another window, dragging it to the right side.
