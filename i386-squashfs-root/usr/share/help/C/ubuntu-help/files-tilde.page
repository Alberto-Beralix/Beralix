<title>What is a file with a "~" at the end of its name?</title>

<note>
<p>Files with a "~" at the end of their names (for example, <file>example.txt~</file>) are automatically created backup copies of documents edited in the <app>Gedit</app> text editor, as well as in other applications. It is normally safe to delete them, but there really is no need to. </p>

<p>These files are hidden by default. If you are seeing them, that is because you either selected <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Hidden Files</gui></guiseq> or pressed <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq>. You can hide them again by repeating one of these steps. </p> 
</note>

<p>These files are treated in the same way as normal hidden files. See <link xref="files-hidden"/> for advice on dealing with hidden files.</p>
