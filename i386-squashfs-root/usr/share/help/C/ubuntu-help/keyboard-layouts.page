  <title>Use alternate keyboard layouts</title>

  <p>Keyboards come in hundreds of different layouts for different languages.
  Even for a single language, there are often multiple keyboard layouts, such
  as the Dvorak layout for English. You can make your keyboard behave like a
  keyboard with a different layout, regardless of the letters and symbols
  printed on the keys. This is useful if you often switch between multiple
  languages.</p>

  <steps>
    <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the top panel and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>In the Hardware section, click <gui>Keyboard</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Switch to the <gui>Layouts</gui> tab.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click the <gui>Add</gui> button, select a layout under the <gui>By country</gui> or <gui>By language</gui> 
tabs, and click <gui>Add</gui>.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>When you add multiple layouts, you can quickly switch between them using
  the keyboard layout indicator menu in the panel. The menu will display a short
  string identifying the current layout, such as <gui>USA</gui> or <gui>GBr</gui> for the standard
  English layout. Click the layout indicator and select the layout you want to
  use from the menu.</p>

  <p>When you use multiple layouts, you can choose to have all windows use the
  same layout or to set a different layout for each window. Using a different
  layout for each window is useful, for example, if you're writing an article
  in another language in a word processor window. Your keyboard selection will
  be remembered for each window as you switch between windows.</p>

  <p>By default, new windows will use the default keyboard layout. You can
  instead choose to have them use the layout of the window you were last
  using. The default layout is the layout at the top of the list. Use the
  <gui>Move Up</gui> and <gui>Move Down</gui> buttons to move layouts up and down in
  the list.</p>
