  <p>You can add multiple user accounts to your computer. Give one account
  to each person in your household or company. Every user has their own
  home folder, documents, and settings.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name in the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select <gui>User Accounts</gui>.</p></item>

  <item><p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> in the top right corner and type your
  password to make changes. You must be an administrative user to add user
  accounts.</p></item>
  <item><p>In the list of accounts on the left, click the <gui>+</gui> button
  to add a new user account.</p></item>
  <item><p>If you want the new user to have administrative access to the computer,
  select <gui>Administrator</gui> for the account type. Administrators can do things
  like add and delete users, install software and drivers, and change the date and
  time.</p></item>
  <item><p>Enter the new user's full name. The username will be filled in automatically
  based on the full name. The default is probably OK, but you can change it if you
  like.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Create</gui> when you're done.</p></item>
  <item><p>The account is initially disabled until you choose what to do about
  the user's password. Under <gui>Login Options</gui> click <gui>Account Disabled</gui>. Use the <gui>Action</gui> drop-down list to set the
  password now, allow the user to log in without a password, or have the user
  set their password the first time they log in.</p>
  <p>If you choose <gui>Set a password now</gui>, have the user type their password
  in the <gui>New password</gui> and <gui>Confirm password</gui> fields. See
  <link xref="user-goodpassword"/>.</p>
  <p>You can also click the button next to the
  <gui>New password</gui> field to select a randomly generated secure password. These
  passwords are hard for others to guess, but they can be hard to remember, so
  be careful.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Change</gui>.</p></item>
</steps>
	
<note><p>If you like, you can click the image next to the user's name on
the right to set an image for the account. This image will be shown in
the login window. GNOME provides some stock photos you can use, or you
can select your own or take a picture with your webcam.</p></note>
