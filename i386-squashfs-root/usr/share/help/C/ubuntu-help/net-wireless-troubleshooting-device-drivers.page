<title>Check your device drivers</title>

  <title>Check for automatically loaded drivers</title>

  <p>
    Your device may already be supported with a preinstalled driver. To check if a driver was
    automatically loaded, run <cmd>sudo lshw -C network</cmd>. Look in the line that
    begins with <gui>configuration:</gui> for the word <em>driver</em>. If this exists, a
    driver has already been installed and loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not running the most recent kernel, update your system first. Drivers,
    especially wireless, are constantly being added and modified. You can do this by clicking
    on the <link xref="unity-appmenu-intro">session menu</link> and selecting <gui>System
    Settings</gui>. In the System section, click <gui>Update Manager</gui>.

  <title>Find additional Linux drivers</title>
  <p>You can check for additional Linux drivers in the following locations:</p>
  <list>
    <item>
      <p>
        Check for a driver by clicking the <link xref="unity-appmenu-intro">session menu</link>
  and selecting <gui>System Settings</gui>. In the Hardware section, click
  <gui>Additional Drivers</gui>. Wait a moment for Ubuntu to update its database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the drivers found in <app>Additional Drivers</app> are proprietary and the source
        code isn't freely available. Therefore, Linux community developers are unable to fix any
        security or functionality problems in the driver. These drivers also cannot be installed
        automatically as part of Ubuntu. If you are willing to accept this limitation, activate
        the driver.

<section id="net-wireless-ndiswrapper">
  <title>Use Ndiswrapper for cards without a Linux driver</title>
  <p>
    If you find your card does not have a Linux driver you could try <app>ndiswrapper</app>.
  </p>
  <list>
    <item>
      <p>
        Check the <link href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ndiswrapper/">device database</link>
        to see if your card is supported by ndiswrapper.

        Full information on ndiswrapper kept on

  <title>Check Driver</title>
  <p>
      If you ran <cmd>lshw -C network</cmd> and saw a driver bound to the device then let's test to make sure it's communicating with the kernel. You can also go back to the
      <link xref="net-wireless-troubleshooting-initial-check">Initial Check page</link>
      to check for any signs of connectivity.
  </p>
  <list type="numbered">
    <item>
      <p>
        Run <cmd>sudo lsmod</cmd> to see if the driver is loaded. Look for the driver name
        that was listed in the "configuration" line output of lshw.
      </p>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
            If you did not see the driver module in the list then use <cmd>sudo modprobe</cmd> to load it.
          </p>
        </item>
      </list>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Run <cmd>sudo iwconfig</cmd>. If you see output like in the example in the command section then the driver is at least identifying the device as a wireless device to the kernel.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
          Run the command <cmd>sudo iwlist scan</cmd> to scan for a wireless access point. If
          an access point is identified, the card is probably working properly as it can
          complete a wireless interface task.
