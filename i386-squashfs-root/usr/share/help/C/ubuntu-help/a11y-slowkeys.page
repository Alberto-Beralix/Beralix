<title>Turn on Slow Keys</title>

  <p>Turn on from the keyboard?! How do I turn these features on from
  the keyboard then? Used to be there were odd shortcuts. I think
  5x Shift turned one of them on. Fix for 3.2</p>

<p>Turn on <em>Slow Keys</em> if you would like there to be a delay between pressing a key and that letter being displayed on the screen. This means that you have to hold down each key you want to type for a little while before it appears. Use slow keys if you accidentally press several keys at a time when you type, or if you find it difficult to press the right key on the keyboard the first time.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>top bar</gui> and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Universal Access</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select the <gui>Typing</gui> tab.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select <gui>Turn on accessibility features from the keyboard</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Switch <gui>Slow Keys</gui> on.</p></item>
</steps>

<note style = "tip"><p>You can quickly turn this feature on and off
from the <link xref="a11y-icon">universal access menu</link>.</p></note>

<p>Use the <gui>Acceptance delay</gui> slider to control how long you have to
hold a key down for it to register.</p>

<p>You can have your computer make a sound when you press a key, when a key
press is accepted, or when a key press is rejected because you didn't hold
the key down long enough.</p>
