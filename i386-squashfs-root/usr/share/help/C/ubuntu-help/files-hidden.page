<title>Hide a file</title>

<p>You can hide files by renaming them with a <key>.</key> at the beginning of their name. Hidden files are invisible by default; they are not displayed in the file manager, but they are still there in the folder.</p>

<p>To hide a file, <link xref="files-rename">rename it</link> with a "." at the beginning of its name. For example, to hide a file <file>example.txt</file>, you should rename it to <file>.example.txt</file>.</p>

<note style="tip">
 <p>You can hide folders in the same way that you can hide files. Rename the folder with a "." at the beginning of its name.</p>

 <p>
 If you want to see all hidden files in a folder, go to that folder and either click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Show Hidden Files</gui></guiseq> or press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq>. All hidden files will be shown along with the files that were not hidden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some hidden files will have a "." at the beginning of their name. Others might have a "~" at the end of their name instead (see <link xref="files-tilde"/>).
 </p>
 <p>
 To hide these files again, either click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Show Hidden Files</gui></guiseq> or press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq> again.
 </p>
 <p>Hidden files will only be shown in the current window, until you turn the
 option for that window off. To show hidden files in all file manager windows,
 see <link xref="nautilus-views"/>.</p>

 <title>Unhide a file</title>
 <p>
 To unhide a file, go to the folder containing the hidden file and click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Show Hidden Files</gui></guiseq>. Then, find the hidden file and rename it so that it doesn't have a "." in front of its name.
 </p>
 <p>
 For example, to unhide a file called <file>.example.txt</file>, you should rename it to <file>example.txt</file>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Once you have renamed the file, you can either click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Show Hidden Files</gui></guiseq> or press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq> to hide any other hidden files again.
