<title>Change who has administrative privileges</title>

<p>Administrative privileges are a way of deciding who can make changes to important parts of the system. You can change which users have administrative privileges and which ones don't. They are a good way of keeping your system secure and preventing potentially damaging unauthorized changes.</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click your name in the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select <gui>User Accounts</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> and enter your password to unlock the account settings. (To give a user admin privileges, you must have admin privileges yourself.)</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Select the user whose privileges you want to change and then click the option next to <gui>Account type</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <!-- FIXME: Check that the definitions below are correct! -->
 <item>
  <list>
   <item>
    <p>Choose <gui>Administrator</gui> if you want the user to be able to perform administrative tasks, like installing new applications.</p>
   </item>
   <item>
    <p>Choose <gui>Standard</gui> if you don't want the user to be able to perform admin tasks.</p>
   </item>
  </list>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Close the User Accounts window. The user's privileges will be changed when they next log in.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<note>
 <p>The first user account on the system has administrative privileges. This is the user account that was created when you first installed the system.</p>
<p> It is unwise to have too many users with <gui>Administrator</gui> privileges on one system.</p>
</note>
