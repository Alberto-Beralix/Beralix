  <title>What to back up</title>

<p>	
Your priority should be to backup your <link xref="backup-thinkabout">most important files</link> as 
well as those that are difficult to recreate.  An example, ranked from most important to least important:
</p>

<terms>
 <item>
   <title>Your personal files</title>
   <p>This may include documents, spreadsheets, email, calendar appointments, financial data, family photos, 
or any other personal files that you would consider irreplaceable.</p>
    </item>

  <item>
  <title>Your personal settings</title>
  <p> This includes changes you may have made to colors, backgrounds, screen resolution 
and mouse settings on your desktop. This also includes application preferences, such as settings 
for <app>LibreOffice</app>, your music player, and your email program. These are replaceable, 
but may take a while to recreate.</p>
</item>

<item>
<title>System settings</title>
<p>Most people never change the system settings that are created during installation. 
If you do customize your system settings for some reason, or if you use your computer as a server, then you may wish to backup these settings.
</p>
</item>

<item>
<title>Installed software</title>
<p>The software you use can normally be restored quite quickly after a serious computer problem, by reinstalling it.</p>
</item>
</terms>

<p>In general, you will want to backup files that are irreplaceable and files 
that require a great time investment to replace without a backup. If things 
are easy to replace, on the other hand, you may not want to use up disk space 
by having backups of them.</p>
