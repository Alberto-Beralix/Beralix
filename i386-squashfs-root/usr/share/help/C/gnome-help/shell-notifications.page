<title>Notifications and the message tray</title>

<section id="what">
<title>What is a notification?</title>
  <p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a
 notification will be shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>
  <p>For example, if you get a new chat message, new updates are available for
 your computer, or your computerâ€™s battery is low, you will get a notification
 informing you.</p>
  <p>To minimize distraction, the notification will first appear as a single
 line. You can move your mouse over it if you want to see its full content.</p>

<title>The message tray</title>
  <p>The message tray gives you a way to get back to your notifications when it
 is convenient for you. It appears when you move your mouse to the bottom right
 corner of the screen, and contains all the notifications that you have not
 acted upon or that permanently reside in it.</p>
  <p>You can view the notifications by clicking on the message tray items. These
 are usually messages sent by applications. However, chat notifications are
 given special treatment, and are represented by the individual contacts who sent
 you the chat messages.</p>
  <p>The message tray is always visible in the activities overview.</p>

  <note style="tip"><p>If the <link xref="keyboard-osk">screen keyboard</link> is open,
 you'll need to click the <gui>tray button</gui> to show the message tray.</p></note>
