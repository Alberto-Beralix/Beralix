<title>File manager behavior preferences</title>
<p>You can control whether you single-click or double-click files, whether
folders are opened in new windows, how executable text files are handled,
and the trash behavior. In any file manager window, click
<guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq> and select the
<gui>Behavior</gui> tab.</p>

  <title><gui>Single click to open items</gui></title>
  <title><gui>Double click to open items</gui></title>
  <p>By default, clicking selects files and double-clicking opens them.
  You can instead choose to have files and folders open when you click on
  them once. When you use single-click mode, you can hold down the
  <key>Ctrl</key> key while clicking to select one or more files.</p>

 <item>
  <title><gui>Open each folder in its own window</gui></title>
  <p>When you open a folder in the file manager, it will normally open in
  the same window. You can right-click a folder and select <gui>Open in
  New Window</gui> to open any single folder in a new window. If you often
  do this, select this option if you would rather have each folder open
  in its own window by default.</p>

<section id="executable">
<title>Executable text files</title>
 <p>An executable text file is a file that contains a program that you can run (execute).  The <link xref="nautilus-file-properties-permissions">file permissions</link> must also allow for the file to run as a program.  The most common are Shell, Python, and Perl scripts.  These have extensions .sh, .py and .pl, respectively.</p>
 <p>You can select to <gui>Run executable text files when they are opened</gui>, <gui>View executable text files when they are opened</gui> or <gui>Ask each time</gui>. If the last option is selected, a window will appear asking if you wish to run or view the selected text file.</p>

<title>Trash</title>

<terms>
 <item>
  <title><gui>Ask before emptying the Trash or deleting files</gui></title>
  <p>This option is selected by default.  When emptying the trash, a message will be displayed confirming that you would like to empty the trash or delete files.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <title><gui>Include a delete command that bypasses Trash</gui></title>
  <p>Selecting this option will add a <gui>Delete</gui> menu item to the <gui>Edit</gui> menu as well as the menu that pops up when you right-click on an item in the <app>Files</app> application.</p>
<note style="warning">
<p>Deleting an item using the <gui>Delete</gui> menu option bypasses the Trash altogether.  The item is removed from the system completely.  There is no way to recover the deleted item.</p>
