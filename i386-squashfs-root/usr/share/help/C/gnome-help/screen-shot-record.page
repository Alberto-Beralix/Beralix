<title>Screenshots and screencasts</title>

  <p>You can take a picture of your screen (a <em>screenshot</em>) or record a
 video of what's happening on the screen (a <em>screencast</em>). This is useful
 if you want to show someone how to do something on the computer, for example.
 Screenshots and screencasts are just normal picture/video files, so you can
 email them and share them on the web.</p>
