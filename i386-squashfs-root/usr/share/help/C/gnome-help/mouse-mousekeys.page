<title>Click and move mouse pointer using the keypad</title>

<p>If you have difficulties using a mouse or other pointing device, you can
control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. This
feature is called <em>mouse keys</em>.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Pointing and Clicking</gui> tab.</p></item>
  <item><p>Switch <gui>Mouse Keys</gui> on.</p></item>
 <item>
  <p>
  Make sure that <key>Num Lock</key> is turned off. You will now be able to 
  move the mouse pointer using the keypad.
  </p>
 </item>
</steps>

 <note style = "tip">
 <p>You can quickly turn mouse keys on and off by clicking the <link xref="a11y-icon">accessibility
 icon</link> on the top bar and selecting <gui>Mouse Keys</gui>.</p>
 </note>

<p>
The keypad is a set of numerical buttons on your keyboard, usually arranged 
into a square grid. If you have a keyboard without a keypad (such as a laptop 
keyboard), you may need to hold down the function (<key>Fn</key>) 
key and use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad. If you use this
feature often on a laptop, you can purchase external USB keypads.
</p>

<p>
Each number on the keypad corresponds to a direction. For example, pressing 
<key>8</key> will move the pointer upwards and pressing <key>2</key> will move 
it downwards. Press the <key>5</key> key to click once with the mouse, or 
quickly press it twice to double-click.
</p>

<p>
Most keyboards have a special key which 
allows you to right-click; it is often near to the space bar. Note, however,
that this key responds to where your keyboard focus is, not where your mouse
pointer is. See <link xref="a11y-right-click"/> for information on how to
right-click by holding down <key>5</key> or the left mouse button.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use the keypad to type numbers while mouse keys is enabled, turn 
<key>Num Lock</key> on. The mouse cannot be controlled with the keypad when 
<key>Num Lock</key> is turned on, though.
</p>

<note>
    <p>
    The normal number keys, in a line at the top of the keyboard, will not 
    control the mouse pointer. Only the keypad number keys can be used.
