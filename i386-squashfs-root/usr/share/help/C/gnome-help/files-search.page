  <title>Search for files</title>
  
  <p>You can search for files based on their name or file type directly
  within the file manager. You can even save common searches, and they
  will appear as special folders in your home folder.</p>

  <links type="topic" style="linklist">
    <title>Other search applications</title>
    <!-- This is an extension point where search apps can add
    their own topics. It's empty by default. -->
  </links>

  <steps>
    <title>Search</title>
    <item><p>Open the <app>Files</app> application from the
    <gui>Activities</gui> overview.</p></item>
    <item><p>If you know the files you want are under a particular
    folder, go to that folder.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click <gui>Search</gui> in the toolbar, or press
    <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>F</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Type a word or words that you know appear in the file
    name and press enter. For example, if you name all your invoices
    with the word "Invoice", type <input>invoice</input>. Press <key>Enter</key>. Words are
    matched regardless of case.</p></item>
    <item><p>You can narrow your results by location and file type. Click
    the <gui>+</gui> button to set more search criteria.</p>
    <list>
      <item><p>Select <gui>Location</gui> from the drop-down list to narrow the
      search results by a starting parent location.</p></item>
      <item><p>Select <gui>File Type</gui> from the drop-down list to narrow the
      search results based on file type.</p></item>
    </list>
    <p>Click the <gui>-</gui> button next to any search option to remove
    that option and widen the search results.</p></item>
    <item><p>You can open, copy, delete, or otherwise work with your
    files from the search results, just as you would from any folder
    in the file manager.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click <gui>Search</gui> in the toolbar again to exit the
    search and return to the folder.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>If you perform certain searches often, you can save them to
  access them quickly.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Save a search</title>
    <item><p>Start a search as above.</p></item>
    <item><p>When you're happy with the search parameters, click
    <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Save Search As</gui></guiseq>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Give the search a name and click <gui>Save</gui>. If you
    like, select a different folder to save the search in. When you
    view that folder, you will see your saved search as an orange
    folder icon with a magnifying glass on it.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>To remove the search file when you are done with it, simply
  <link xref="files-delete">delete</link> the search as you would any other
  file. When you delete a saved search, it does not delete the files that
  the search matched.</p>
