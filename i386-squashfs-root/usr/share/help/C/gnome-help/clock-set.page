<title>Change the date and time</title>

<p>If the date and time displayed on the top bar are incorrect or in the wrong format, you can change them:</p>

<steps>
 <item><p>Click on the clock in the middle of the top bar and select <gui>Date and Time Settings</gui>.</p></item>
 <item><p>You may need to click <gui>Unlock</gui> and type the <link xref="user-admin-explain">admin password</link>.</p></item>
 <item><p>Adjust the date and time by clicking on the arrows to choose the year, day, hour and minute. You can choose the month from a drop-down list.</p></item>
 <item>
  <p>If you like, you can have the clock update itself automatically by switching <gui>Network Time</gui> on.</p>
  <p>When <em>Network Time</em> is switched on, the computer will periodically synchronize its clock with a very accurate clock on the internet, so you don't have to do it manually. This will only work if you are connected to the internet.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>You can also change how the hour is displayed by switching the 24-hour format on or off.</p>
 </item>
