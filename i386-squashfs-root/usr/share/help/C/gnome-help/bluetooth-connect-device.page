  <title>Connect your computer to a Bluetooth device</title>

  <p>Before you can use a Bluetooth device like a mouse or a headset, you first
  need to connect your computer to the device. This is also called pairing the
  Bluetooth devices.</p>

  <note style="important">
    <p>Before you begin, make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your computer.
    See <link xref="bluetooth-turn-on-off"/>.</p>
  </note>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click the Bluetooth icon on the top bar and select <gui>Set up a New Device</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Make the other Bluetooth device <link xref="bluetooth-visibility">discoverable or visible</link>
      and place it within 10 meters (about 33 feet) of your computer. Then select <gui>Forward</gui>. Your
      computer will begin searching for devices.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If there are too many devices listed, use the <gui>Device type</gui> drop-down to display only a single type of device in the list.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select <gui>PIN options...</gui> to set how a PIN will be delivered to the other device.</p>
      <note>
	<p>The automatic PIN setting will use a six-digit numerical code. A device with no input keys or screen, such as a mouse or headset, may require a specific PIN such as 0000, or no PIN at all. Check your device's manual for the proper setting.</p>
      </note>
      <p>Choose an appropriate PIN setting for your device, and then select <gui>Close</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Continue</gui> to proceed.  If you did not choose a preset PIN, the PIN will be displayed on the screen.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If required, confirm the PIN on your other device. The device should show you
      the PIN you see on your computer screen, or may prompt you to enter the PIN.
      Confirm the PIN on the device, then click <gui>Matches</gui>.</p>
      <p>Enter the PIN code on your other device, if required. Sometimes the other device
      will simply show you the PIN and ask you to confirm that it matches what you see on
      your computer.</p>
      <p>You need to finish your entry within about 20 seconds on most devices, or the
      connection will not be completed. If that happens, return to the device list and
      start again.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>A message appears when the connection successfully completes. Click <gui>Close</gui>.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>You can <link xref="bluetooth-remove-connection">remove a Bluetooth connection</link> later if desired.</p>
