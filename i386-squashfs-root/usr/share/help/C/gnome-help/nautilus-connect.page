<title>Browse files on a server or network share</title>

<p>You can connect to a server or network share to browse and
view files on that server, exactly as if they were on your
own computer. This is a convenient way to download or upload 
files on the internet, or to share files with other people on
your local network.</p>

<p>To browse files over the network, open the <app>Files</app>
application from the <gui>Activities</gui> overview. Then, click 
<gui>Browse Network</gui> in the sidebar, or select
<gui>Network</gui> from the <gui>Go</gui> menu. The file manager
will find any computers on your local area network that advertise
their ability to serve files. If you want to connect to a server
on the internet, or if you do not see the computer you're looking
for, you can manually connect to a server by typing in its 
internet/network address.</p>

<steps>
  <title>Connect to a file server</title>
  <item><p>In the file manager, click <guiseq><gui>File</gui>
  <gui>Connect to Server</gui></guiseq>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Enter the server address, select the type of server, and enter
  any additional information as required. Then click <gui>Connect</gui>.
  Details on server types are <link xref="#types">listed below</link>.</p>
  <p>For servers on the internet, you can usually use the domain name 
  (e.g. <sys>ftp.example.com</sys>). For computers on your local network, 
  however, you may have to use the computer's 
  <link xref="net-findip">numeric IP address</link>.</p>
  </item>
  <item><p>A new window will open showing you the files on the server.
  You can browse the files just as you would for those on your own computer.</p>
  <p>The server will also be added to the sidebar so you can access it quickly 
  in the future</p>

 <title>Different types of server</title>

<p>You can connect to different types of servers. Some servers
are public, and allow anybody to connect. Other servers require
you to log in with a user name and password.</p>
<p>You may not have permissions to perform certain actions on files 
on a server. For example, on public FTP sites, you will probably not be
able to delete files.</p>

<title>Types of server</title>
<item>
  <title>SSH</title>
  <p>If you have a <em>secure shell</em> account on a server, you
  can connect using this method. Many web hosts provide SSH accounts
  to members so they can securely upload files. SSH servers always
  require you to log in. If you use a secure shell key to log in,
  leave the password field blank.</p>
  
  <comment><cite>shaunm</cite><p>We should have a topics on encryption
  keys, possibly rolling the seahorse help into gnome-help. Then link
  from here.</p></comment>
  
  <p>When using SSH, all the data you send (including your password)
  is encrypted so that other users on your network can't see it.</p>
</item>
<item>
  <title>FTP (with login)</title>
  <p>FTP is a popular way of exchanging files on the Internet.
  Because data is not encrypted over FTP, many servers now provide
  access through SSH. Some servers, however, still allow or require
  you to use FTP to upload or download files. FTP sites with logins
  will usually allow you to delete and upload files.</p>
</item>
<item>
  <title>Public FTP</title>
  <p>Sites that allow you to download files will sometimes provide
  public or anonymous FTP access. These servers do not require a
  user name and password, and will usually not allow you to delete
  or upload files.</p>
  <p>Some anonymous FTP sites require you to log in with a
  public user name and password, or with a public user name using
  your email address as the password. For these servers, use the
  <gui>FTP (with login)</gui> method, and use the credentials
  specified by the FTP site.</p>
</item>
<item>
  <title>Windows share</title>
  <p>Windows computers use a proprietary protocol to share files over a local
  area network. Computers on a Windows network are sometimes grouped into
  <em>domains</em> for organization and to better control access. If you have
  the right permissions on the remote computer, you can connect to a Windows
  share from the file manager.</p>
</item>
<item>
  <title>WebDAV and Secure WebDAV</title>
  <p>Based on the HTTP protocol used on the web, WebDAV is sometimes used to
  share files on a local network and to store files on the internet. If the
  server you're connecting to supports secure connections, you should choose
  this option. Secure WebDAV uses strong SSL encryption, so that other users 
  can't see your password.</p>

    <p>Also used by gnome-user-share, but we're not talking about that
    in gnome-help for 3.0. Hopefully it will be better integrated in 3.2,
    and we can discuss it better in the help. If that happens, link from
    here.</p>
