 <title>Checking the hard disk</title>
  <p>Hard disks have a built-in health-check tool called <app>SMART</app> 
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), which continually 
checks the disk for potential problems. SMART also warns you if the disk 
is about to fail, helping you avoid loss of important data.</p>

  <p>Although SMART runs automatically, you can also check your disk's 
health by running the <app>Disk Utility</app> application:</p>

<steps>
  <title>Check your disk's health using the Disk Utility application</title>
     <item><p>Open the <app>Disk Utility</app> application from the 
<gui>Activities</gui> overview.</p></item>
     <item><p>Select the disk you want to check from the <gui>Storage Devices
</gui> list. Information and status of the disk will appear under <gui>Drive
</gui>.</p></item>
     <item><p><gui>SMART Status</gui> should say "Disk is healthy".</p></item> 
     <item><p>Click the <gui>SMART Data</gui> button to view more drive 
information, or to run a self-test.</p></item>
</steps>

 <title>What if the disk isn't healthy?</title>
 <p>Even if the <gui>SMART Status</gui> indicates that the disk <em>isn't</em> 
healthy, there may be no cause for alarm. However, it's better to be prepared 
with a <link xref="backup-why">backup</link> to prevent data loss.</p>

 <p>If the status says "Pre-fail", the disk is still reasonably healthy but 
signs of wear have been detected which mean it might fail in the near future. 
If your hard disk (or computer) is a few years old, you are likely to see 
this message on at least some of the health checks. You should <link 
xref="backup-how">backup your important files regularly</link> and check 
the disk status periodically to see if it gets worse.</p>

 <p>If it gets worse, you may wish to take the computer/hard disk to a 
professional for further diagnosis or repair.</p>
