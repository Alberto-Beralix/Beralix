<title>Test the performance of your hard disk</title>

<p>If you want to perform benchmark test and see how fast is your hard disk:</p>

<steps>

    <item><p>Open the <app>Disk Utility</app> application from the <gui>Activities</gui> overview.</p></item>
    <item><p>You can choose the hard disk from the <gui>Storage Devices</gui> list. Information about the disk and its status will appear under  <gui>Drive</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Choose <gui>Benchmark</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click <gui>Start Read-Only Benchmark</gui> to test how fast data can be read off the disk or <gui>Start Read/Write Benchmark</gui> to  test how fast data can be read off the disk and how fast data can be put onto the disk. The last option will take longer to complete.</p></item>

</steps> 

<p>When the test is finished, the results will appear on the graph.</p>

 <p>It would be really really great if somebody could write something about the results and the charts, I can't do that... I don't really know what does it mean. thanks.</p>
