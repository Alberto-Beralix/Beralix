  <title>Set screen brightness</title>

  <p>You can change the brightness of your screen to save power or
  make the screen more readable in bright light. You can also have
  the screen dim automatically when on battery power and have it
  turn off automatically when not in use.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Set the brightness</title>
    <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select <gui>Screen</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Adjust the <gui>Brightness</gui> slider to a comfortable value.</p>
    <p>Many laptop keyboards have special keys on the keyboard to adjust the brightness.
    These have a picture of what looks like the Sun and are usually located on the <key>F8</key> and <key>F9</key> keys. Hold
    down the <key>Fn</key> key to use these keys.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>Select <gui>Dim screen to save power</gui> to have the brightness
  automatically lowered when you're on battery power. The backlight of
  your screen can take a lot of power and significantly reduce how
  long your battery will last before it needs to be recharged.</p>

  <p>The screen will automatically turn off after you haven't used it
  for a while. This only affects the display, and doesn't turn off
  your computer. You can adjust how long you have to be inactive
  with the <gui>Turn off after</gui> drop-down list.</p>
