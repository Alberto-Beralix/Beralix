<title>What is the "windows" key?</title>

  <p>When you press the <em>windows</em> key, the activities overview is
 displayed. This key can usually be found on the bottom-left of your keyboard,
 next to the <key>Alt</key> key, and often has a window/squares icon on it. It
 is sometimes called the super key, logo key, or system key.</p>

<note>
  <p>If you have an Apple keyboard, there will not be a windows key on your
 keyboard. The <key>Cmd</key> (Command) key can be used instead.</p>
</note>
