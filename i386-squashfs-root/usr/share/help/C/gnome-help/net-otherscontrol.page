<p>I know there were polkit policy changes. Not sure if this is
100% on the money for 3.2. Double-check when possible</p>

<p>If you can edit a network connection but other users on your computer can't, you may have set the connection to be <gui>available to all users</gui>. This makes it so that everyone on the computer can <em>connect</em> using that connection, but only users <link xref="user-admin-explain">with administrative rights</link> are allowed to change its settings.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that, since everyone is affected if the settings are changed, only highly-trusted (admin) users should be allowed to modify the connection.</p>

<p>If other users really need to be able to change the connection themselves, make it so the connection is <em>not</em> set to be available to everyone on the computer. This way, everyone will be able to manage their own connection settings rather than relying on one set of shared, system-wide settings for the connection.</p>

<steps>
 <title>Make it so that the connection isn't shared any more</title>
 <item>
  <p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Open <gui>Network</gui> and select <gui>Wired</gui> or <gui>Wireless</gui> from the list on the left, depending on which connection you want to change.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>From the <gui>Network Name</gui> drop-down list, select the connection you want everyone to be able to manage/edit themselves and then click <gui>Options</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>You will have to enter your admin password to change the connection. Only admin users can do this.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Uncheck <gui>Available to all users</gui> and click <gui>Save</gui>. Other users of the computer will now be able to manage the connection themselves.</p>
