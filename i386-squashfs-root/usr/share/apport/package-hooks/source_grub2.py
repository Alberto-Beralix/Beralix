        # The quotes are Unicode quotes, not valid in the shell and probably

        # instruction to run the 'splash' command with argument 'nomodeset”'
        # and with the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT environment variable set
        # to '”quiet'.  'sh -n' allows this because this is a valid parse
        # and it's possible that the command 'splash' might exist, but what
        # we need to know is whether sourcing the file will fail.

        # file is already sourced as root when running update-grub, so it
        # seems unlikely that this could do any further harm.
