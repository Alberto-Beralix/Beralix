<P>CUPS 1.5 many changes and new features to CUPS 1.4.x. This page provides a high-level outline of these changes. If you have never used CUPS before, read the <A HREF="overview.html">"Overview of CUPS"</A> document instead.</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="COMMANDS">Commands</A></H2>

<OL START="1">

	<LI><EM>User defaults;</EM> Starting in CUPS 1.2, user defaults were stored in the ~/.cups directory, and the old ~/.cupsrc and ~/.lpoptions files were deprecated. Support for ~/.cupsrc and ~/.lpoptions have been removed in CUPS 1.5.</LI>

	<LI><EM>IPP test tool;</EM> The <code>ipptool</code> IPP test tool is now a first-class user program.</LI>

	<LI><EM>lpadmin;</EM> The <code>lpadmin</code> command now supports setting the cupsIPPSupplies and cupsSNMPSupplies keywords in PPDs and deleting options.</LI>

	<LI><EM>HTTP support:</EM> Applications can now set a per-connection timeout interval and callback for HTTP operations as well as query and set SSL/TLS X.509 certificates.</LI>

	<LI><EM>Raster support;</EM> The CUPS raster functions now support the creation of PWG Raster files and streams, and a new callback-based context function allows reading and writing from objects other than file descriptors.</LI>
