=head1 DESCRIPTION

Glib maps flag and enum values to the nicknames strings provided by the
underlying C libraries.  Representing flags this way in Perl is an interesting
problem, which Glib solves by using some cool overloaded operators. 

The functions described here actually do the work of those overloaded
operators.  See the description of the flags operators in the "This Is
Now That" section of L<Glib> for more info.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 scalar = $class-E<gt>B<new> ($a)

=over

=item * $a (scalar) 

=back

Create a new flags object with given bits.  This is for use from a
subclass, it's not possible to create a C<Glib::Flags> object as such.
For example,

    my $f1 = Glib::ParamFlags->new ('readable');
    my $f2 = Glib::ParamFlags->new (['readable','writable']);

An object like this can then be used with the overloaded operators.

=head2 scalar = $a-E<gt>B<all> ($b, $swap)

=over

=item * $b (scalar) 

=item * $swap (scalar) 

=back

=head2 ref = $a->B<as_arrayref>

=over

=back



=head2 integer = $a-E<gt>B<bool> ($b, $swap)

=over

=item * $b (scalar) 

=item * $swap (integer) 

=back



=head2 integer = $a-E<gt>B<eq> ($b, $swap)
