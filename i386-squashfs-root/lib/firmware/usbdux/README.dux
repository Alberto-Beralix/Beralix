To compile the firmware for the USBDUX and USBDUXfast
-----------------------------------------------------
Download the as31 from:

http://www.berndporr.me.uk/as31/

(this is a patched version of as31 which supports an
include directive).

Install it in this directory.

Then run "make -f Makefile_dux".
