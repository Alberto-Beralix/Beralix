# configuration for gamin
# Can be used to override the default behaviour.
# notify filepath(s) : indicate to use kernel notification
# poll filepath(s)   : indicate to use polling instead
# fsset fsname method poll_limit : indicate what method of notification for 
#                                    the filesystem
#                                  kernel - use the kernel for notification
#                                  poll - use polling for notification
#                                  none - don't use any notification
#                                  
#                                  the poll_limit is the number of seconds
#                                  that must pass before a resource is polled 
#                                  again. It is optional, and if it is not 
#                                  present the previous value will be used 
#                                  or the default.  
#
# Some examples: 
# notify /mnt/local* /mnt/pictures* # use kernel notification on these paths
# poll /temp/*                      # use poll notification on these paths
# fsset nfs poll 10                 # use polling on nfs mounts and poll once 
                                    # every 10 seconds
