Help for TSI Navigator 80

"c-" means cursor, "d-" means display.
"dn" means down, "rt" is right, "lt" is left.
Thus:
cLt cRt cUp cDn: those are the center left/right/up/down keys.
dLt dRt: are the extremity keys.
dUp dDn: the second keys from the extremities.
"Lx" is the square key left of cLt.
"Rx" is the square key right of cRt.
"CR#" means cursor routing key (sensor switch) number #.
"+" means keys are combined (pressed together).
