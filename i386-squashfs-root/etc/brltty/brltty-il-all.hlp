Help for IrisLinux

To enter in the Learn-Mode, click on the "I Z" cell to enter in the 
internal
menu and then click the "Help" item.
If you don't know how the menu system works, (if you never used Scriba or 
DraculaWin), an explaination of the work can be found in the README.menu file,
located in the EuroBraille directory of your brltty copy.

Using Cut And Paste
-------------------
	To begin a block, press "*E" (or Beta+L1) and then click on the 
cell where you want to start the block.
To end a block press "*M" (or Beta+L9), and cliak on the cell you want 
to end 
the block. 
When you type "*M" (or Beta+L9), and click on a cell, the block is 
copied into
the brltty clipboard, waiting to be pasted anywhere you want. To paste a 
block,
press the "*L" (or Beta+L8).

Warning: This functionality is not implemented for Iris yet.


Note
----
Please note that the README file contains also version informations and
copyright notice, so if you find a bug that was not listed out in the README
file, feel free to send an e-mail to me (yan@mistigri.org), because it's
hard to test all possible functions, even if I use the driver 10 hours a day. 
Thank you.
