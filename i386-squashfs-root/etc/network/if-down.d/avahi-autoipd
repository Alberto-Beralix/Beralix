# Description:      Remove routes to allow communication between machines which
#                   only have an IPv4LL address assigned and those which only
#                   have a routable address assigned. These were added by
#                   /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-autoipd.
#
#                   See http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2004/qa1357.html for
#                   more information.
