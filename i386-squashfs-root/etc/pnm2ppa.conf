# Sample configuration file 
#
# This file will be automatically read upon startup if it is placed in
# /etc/pnm2ppa.conf
#
# uncomment entries by removing "#" to activate them.
#
#-----------set the printer model---------------------------
# The printer model will normally  be set by a -v <model> command
# line argument.   Otherwise, if not set in the configuration file
# it defaults to the 710/720 series.   Remove/comment out the line
# "version 0" below to get the default choice.
# 
# If there is more than one "version" entry activated, the last one
# will be used.   The printer version can also be set with the command line
# option e.g., "-v 720".

version  710
#version  720	# 710, 712, 722 also acceptable
#version  820
#version 1000


#--------control system log messages from pnm2ppa-------------------
# pnm2ppa issues progress and error messages to the system log (syslog).
# For security reasons, no  input from the user is ever sent to the syslog.
# The setting "silent 1" suppresses messages to the syslog.   The
# setting "verbose 1"  sends messages to the standard error stream (stderr)
# in addition to the syslog. (Note: if pnm2ppa was compiled with the
# -D__NO_SYSLOG__ option (e.g., for BeOS),  syslog messages are
# diverted to stderr; use "silent 1" to suppress them.)

#silent 1
#verbose 1

# (NEW FEATURE:)
# standard informational messages ( when a job starts, when each page
# prints, job finished, etc.) will not be recorded in the System Log,
# unless explicitly activated here with the "log_info 1" keyword.
# (i.e., "log_info 0" is the default.)
# (Informational messages will still always be sent  to stderr in "verbose" 
# mode, even if log_info is not set.)

log_info 1               # <= COMMENT THIS OUT TO GET THE NEW DEFAULT BEHAVIOR!

# Note: the "silent 1" and "log_info" keywords are only accepted from the 
# system configuration  file (/etc/pnm2ppa.conf), and not from configuration 
# files specified  by users with the pnm2ppa option "-f".

#---------set the margins of the printed page-------------------
# Margins: these are distances from the edges of the paper in
# "dots" ( 600 dots = 1 inch = 2.54 cm).   
# Nothing outside these margins will be printed. 
# Default values are give below;  uncomment  and change, if necessary. 
# (Older versions of pnm2ppa required larger left and right margins to avoid 
# printer failure with  "flashing lights", but this  problem is believed to 
# be solved)

#topmargin      10 
#bottommargin   150
#leftmargin     10
#rightmargin    10

#----------center the printer output on the paper-------------------
# Offsets: these are adjustments for centering the print correctly on the
# paper.   Units are dots (1/600 inch).   Add a positive number of dots to
# xoff to move the printed image  to the  right, relative to the paper.
# add to yoff to move it  down.   The helper program calibrate_ppa prints
# a test page to  check the offsets (see CALIBRATON.txt):
# usage: "calibrate_ppa --center | pnm2ppa --bw  - - | lpr -l
# Default values are:

#xoffset   160
#yoffset    50

#------------align the  black and color ink cartridges--------
# Color Offsets: these control alignment between the black  ink
# and color ink print cartridges.   This changes a little  whenever  you  
# replace an ink cartridge, so the default values are just approximate.
#
# Use "calibrate_ppa --align  | pnm2ppa --fd - - | lpr -l "
# to print a test page to help you adjust the color offsets.
#
# The first line checks horizontal alignment ColOffsX,: 
# The second line checks vertical alignment ColOffsY,: 
# The alignment  is correct if alignment patterns "0" is best.   
# If a diffent alignment pattern is best, add or subtract the  + or
# - value shown below it to ColOffsX or ColOffSy.
# 
# See CALIBRATION.txt for more details.
# Use "calibrate_ppa --test  | pnm2ppa --fd - - | lpr -l " to check your
# new settings.

#ColOffsX	0
#ColOffsY	0

#---------------"shearing" corrections-------------------------------------
# shearing correction (for bidirectional printing modes)
# if there is a horizontal offset between right-to-left and left-to-right
# sweeps of the print head, adjust these in units of 1"/600 (1 dot). 
# There are separate corrections colorshear and blackshear for the 
# color and black  print heads.  The third and fourth lines of the
# alignment test page (see above) tests these.   
# The setting is correct when alignments "0" are correct.
# The (positive or negative) number shown under the best-aligned shearing 
# alignment pattern tells you how much to change the colorshar or blackshear
# value by.   (For, example, if you print the calibration page with 
# "colorshear 0" (the default value) and the best pattern is labelled "-2", 
# uncomment the "colorshear" value below and set it equal to -2.)

#colorshear    0
#blackshear    0

#-------------blackness control-----------------------------
# this controls the density of black ink used. 
# valid blackness choices are 1 2 3 4; controls the
# density of black ink used: 1 (least ink), 2 (default), 4 (most).
# 0 = no black ink.   This affects black ink bordered by whitespace
# only  (e.g. text, but not black in color images)

#blackness 2   

#------------Color correct curve Gamma parameters-------------------------
# Gamma color correction values for Red, Green and Blue:
# (Note: a more effective method of color correction is to use
# a calibration file /etc/pnm2ppa.gamma, in which case these
# Gamma values will not be used.  See COLOR.html or COLOR.txt) 
# The pnm2ppa option --noGamma suppresses color correction.

# The  standard Gamma  enhancement  curve is 
# gEnh(i) = (int) ( pow ( (double) i / 256, Gamma ) * 256 ) 
# (i.e., 256 times ( i*(1.0/256)) to the power Gamma ),
# where (int) i is the ppm color intensity, in the range 0 - 255.
# positive values of Gamma enhance  (increase the intensity of)
# the corresponding color.   Gamma = 1.0 corresponds to no
# color correction, gEnh[i] = i.

# You can specify Gamma values as a decimal number for each primary color

#GammaR 1.0      # red enhancement
#GammaG 1.0      # green enhancement
#GammaB 1.0      # blue enhancement

# For use with the printed output of "pnm2ppa -g ",
# you can also specify Gamma values using the integer GammaIdx,
# which gives Gamma = 1.0 - 0.033 * GammaIdx :

#RedGammaIdx	0     
#GreenGammaIdx	0
#BlueGammaIdx	0

# Default papersize (only used for printing the color calibration
# test page with pnm2ppa -g).  
# Valid choices are: a4, letter, legal:

#papersize letter    # this is the default  
#papersize legal
#papersize a4

#-----------suppress bidirectional printing---------------------

# by default the printing sweeps are now bidirectional (unimode 0);
# to make  unidirectional printing (left-to-right) the default behavior,
# (unimode 1) uncomment the next line .  (The command line options --uni 
# and --bi override the default behavior).  You might wish to print 
# unidirectionally to avoid shearing effects in high-quality
# color images, for example)

#unimode 1

#------------switch off (color) data compression------------------
# Previously, data compression of color data sent to the printer
# was not enabled.    It is now enabled by default, but has only
# been tested on HP71x/72xC models.   Uncomment and set "compression 0"
# to disable color data compression  if necessary.

#compression 1

#=====================================================================
# the following are switches for debugging purposes only:
# set their values to 0 to switch off the corresponding ink type:

#black_ink 1
#color_ink 1
#cyan_ink 1
#magenta_ink 1
#yellow_ink 1
