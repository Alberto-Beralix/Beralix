  # on xdm and gdm, but not on startx, slim, nodm).

  # It isn't really D-Bus' place to do this - we're changing the environment
  # of everything executed from Xsession.d, not just dbus-launch - but having
  # X apps whose stdin is the console makes very little sense, so arguably
  # startx, slim, nodm etc. should be doing this themselves.
